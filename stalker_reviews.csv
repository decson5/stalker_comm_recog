"Excellent Graphics, Innovative Gameplay. 
Highly recommended.",positive
"When I run the game it was very laggy and not smooth at all. I tried lowering the graphic setting lower and lower, at the lowest ""low"" setting it was still lagging!! Maybe because my system and RTX3080 is too outdated? maybe...but it runs other games just fine though? It's just not in the very high graphic setting.
Should I just buy 5090 or 5080 and try the game again? I CAN'T EVEN BUY THOSE GPU EVEN IF I HAD MONEY!!

So...I give up, it's too late for refund now and it's a d*** Ultimate Edition...

Good luck my fellows stalkers if you could buy the game to support the DEV, but I don't recommend you to do so at this state of the game.

Well, I'll just go back Cheeky Breeky at Anomaly again...",negative
"I bought the ultimate physical edition, and im currently waiting for that to arrive here in April... Do i regret it? no! i think this is going to be an awesome game and im happy to support the developers! (plus the stuff that comes with it is awesome.. but thats apart from the point.)
but do i think you should buy it? also no, or at least not in its current state. Im even currently holding off from playing through the game to allow it to reach a state I'm happy with. This has every opportunity to become a great and amazing game, but its not there yet. Give it time, come back around the one year anniversary maybe, see how its doing then.",negative
"I used a mod to make the game run more stable and now i have no FPS drops, and very minor stuttering on occasion, only because i'm running the game on High settings. If I turn down draw distance and foliage rendering there are no issues. Mod download was literally one file, and took approx 5 mins to download, install, and find the best settings to run the game. Google a stability fix and it was the first one on Nexus. Running on an RTX 4060ti and i7 intel processor w/ 32gb of RAM. 

Just got out of the lesser zone, which is the first starter area, maybe i'd go as far to say its a tutorial zone. I was never familiar with Stalker previously but I very much enjoy the concept. I was too late helping one of the dudes giving out quests, because i was busy exploring, by the time I got there he died. Ended up looting his stuff and killing the mutants in the area. RIP. Even side quests let you choose to help, or screw someone over. I've had more meaningful choices in quests in the first few hours of this game than most recent RPGs. English voice over work is pretty good, and the setting is killer. Playing this game at night, or with all the lights off, sets a great vibe. Combat is fun and rewarding, although sometimes pretty challenging; Weapon modding is setup alright and adding attachments is easy enough. Vendor stuff is pretty expensive but i'm guessing they really want you to explore, or quest, to find things. Definitely an interesting experience, if you let yourself get immersed in the game. No fast travel as far as I can tell, but it works super well as traversing the Zone is part of the game as well.

Remember the first playthrough of Skyrim when you didn't fast travel everywhere, and things weren't just a checklist? You'd run into some enemies, a world event occurs, or some random ass NPC that you could trade with appears TF outta the forest. That's the stuff that builds the world and makes it feel a little more real, and that's what traversing the Zone feels like. Random encounters and anomalies make traveling from one area to another feel great. This is all within, like 4 hours of gameplay, maybe 5?

I'll update this when I have some more hours into the game. Hopefully we get some updates for stability and maybe a slight rebalance to vendors and crafting costs. If the first patch is anything to go by GSC is very clearly paying attention to the game and fixing things where it is needed. The patch notes even block out potential spoilers and have a plethora of fixes and rebalances listed. I think many people will stick with the game and give it a chance if there's no need for a mod pack to stabilize everything. Given the current situation of their location, i'm willing to bet they're completing as much work as they can. Wait and give them a chance to fix things or purchase now and understand you might have some hiccups.

Happy hunting stalker",positive

"Heard STALKER 1 was great. STALKER 2 has not proven that to me so far. 

Needs a lot of optimization. Seems like there's a lot of that going around these days.

Crappy Frames on 3090. Low-Medium settings for smooth frames.

Game Crashes. 

150+GB storage needed but visually it isn't breathtaking.

"This creation might appeal to those with a nostalgic perspective—people who played the previous version of the game. I, too, would love to see some of my favorite games from 10–20 years ago revived with a slight graphical update for a nostalgic trip.  

But I never played the original S.T.A.L.K.E.R., and I'm judging this so-called masterpiece as a brand-new 2024 game priced like a AAA title. And from the standpoint of modern games—even those that aren’t cutting-edge — this is garbage! Cheap trash in every way.  

The game is outdated in every aspect — graphics, control responsiveness, open-world design, and, as the cherry on top of this crap, awful icons. I forgot to return this junk within the 14-day window, requested a refund later, and was denied.  

So here’s my honest review of your damn game. I will permanently remove it from my library out of principle and will downvote it everywhere it’s mentioned because I have every moral right to do so — I paid $60 for this stinking piece of work, and I will express my opinion about it freely.",negative
Amazing game.,positive
"This game on Steam has a lot of bugs and gets regular crashes . BUT  , the Version on Windows Game Pass runs much much better , almost without any problems.",negative
"game is broken for me near end game, the guy in the cut-scene just disappears, 
after trying new game, other cut-scenes just are just broken, this game is broken!!!! quests wise,  and performance wise

"Even if there are a few issues I feel that complete experience more than makes up for it.
The game is currently in an OK state even if future patches are sure to improve it.

Game is good.",positive
" Well, let's begin, I'm probably ready to express my opinion after 100 hours and several playthroughs.
 At the time of patch 1.2.1, the game is doing badly with performance leaks, not only is the processor somewhere in a relaxed state sipping a cold martini, but the video card and RAM are working hard for three. The video memory decided that it was tired of working, and decided to unload everything into the RAM and lost everything along the way.
 And so, if you like to shoot, run around and watch unskippable cutscenes, bugs, problems with FPS...
 Then go ahead, flag in hand, go to all the endings.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Ну, начнём, я наверное через 100 часов и нескольких прохождений готов высказать своё мнение.
 На момент патча 1.2.1 в игре всё плохо с утечками производительности, мало того что процессор где-то в расслабленном состоянии попивает холодный мартини, так и видеокарта с оперативкой работают за троих в поте лица. Видеопамять решила что ей работать надоело, и решила всё выгрузить в оперативу и по пути всё потеряла.
 А так, если любите пострелять, побегать и посмотреть непропускаемые катсцены, баги, проблемы с фпс...

"great game!
needs some fixes but its playable.
was worth the wait!",positive
its dopeeeeeeeeee,positive
"Every ruined building, forest  and radiation soaked wasteland hold secrets waiting to be uncovered.
Survival mechanics are inmersive, weather system and realistic day-night cycle enhance the tension.
Sound design plays a massive role in inmersion, distant howls, rustling grass, eerie echoes make every step feel uneasy.
Mutants lurking in the zone keeps players on edge, pack of blind dogs or towering bloodsucker waiting to strike, every encounter feels like a fight for survival.
Welcome to the zone, stalker, pack your gear and rememer: the zone doesn't forgive mistakes.",positive
"TLDR: not a great a stalker game, in general a very good (and playable) game.

Many people do not like Stalker 2 for the fact it does not feel like a Stalker game. However, being rather new to the Stalker community, and not having played the older ones (which I probably will), the fact it doesn't feel like a stalker game, this isn't a huge issue for me personally. However, with that being said, stalker 2 has really been enjoyable, I would recommend it. Much of the issues (ex: the bugs in the game), have for a majority seem to have been fixed. atleast during my playtime I have not experienced many bugs or any outright game breaking bugs. The combat could see some improvements, along with the AI sometimes (ive had a couple incidents where enemies don't see me despite being right infront of them lol). The 2 biggest issues I have with the enemies in detail is how stupidly accurate the AI can be. I understand this is not meant to be a Fallout game where you can tank 2000 bullets and be fine, or shoot someone in the head a ton and they take little damage, but if its night time, raining, with a ton of bushes, grass, trees, etc around my enemy should not be able to shoot me so often from far distances away. they should have difficulty seeing me, hitting follow up shots, etc, as the same way I would have. Another issue I have is the general bullet sponges mutants can sometimes be. It should not take like 10 RPG shots to bring down a chimera, 3 would make much more sense. But apart from these 2 minor-moderate issues, I think the game is great, especially if you like games with good stories. Overall rating, 7.6/10.",positive
"Really tried to enjoy this one, but between the persistent crashes and show-stopper progression bugs... it's a technical mess the deeper in you go. Worth a revisit in a year or so when its patched more thoroughly. Really disappointing",negative
"True Stalkers know their way around the jank and not leave bad reviews.

Stalker 2 suffers from optimization issues however, it is an excellent RPG with outstanding combat, story and atmosphere unmatched in any modern AAA game in its genre.",positive
"Can not recommend it currently because of lack of optimization and missing A-Life 2.0.
Also, mouse sensitivity X and Y Axis are not matched, no fix for that since release.

I don't know what went wrong, but if it is Microsoft fault for not letting them delay the game, it is Microsoft fault.
I cut them slack because they are in a war, but I just can not recommend it to anyone YET.",negative

"Glory to Ukraine, to it's defenders and people!
Thank you for another entry in the STALKER saga.
Nice to be back in the Zone.

The game is not flawless but so far it hasn't been as dismal as others are saying.
But every PC is different and thus people have different issues.
My main gripe is the performance and optimization. Once that's settled, it can be a great game.",positive
"Intense game, no political bs. Just for that, 10/10",positive
"!!! This is so very much like the original S.T.A.L.K.E.R. for me, and also the better mods that I played felt the same, despite having different enhancements !!!  (For the record, I played the ""Misery"" and ""Alpha"" mods, as well as a few others.)  Also, I only played on ""STALKER"" mode, not the NOVICE nor HARD modes.  Went from 400 deaths for the first playthough to about 100 deaths for the other 2 playthroughs.

Why should you buy and play this game?
1) Because you love the original 3 games and mods
2) Because this is so much better than those previous games in all facets ... (imo!)
3) Because this game is gorgeous to look at
4) Because those annoying ""crashity"" bugs have been ironed out
5) Because there are 4 alternative endings
6) Because there is so much background/historic narrative included now
7) Because the Inventory system has been made ""betterer""

What's to love about this new-and-improved version?
a) The story is big (x4)
b) Places and names familiar yet vastly built upon
c) Characters are familiar, and their stories feel relevant
d) So many more different artefacts, but effects are few, familiar, and stackable
e) Again, this game is gorgeous to look at !!!  Keep your ""camera"" handy at all times!
f) Compelling and believable new characters ... likeable and otherwise

Everything felt so like SoC, CS, and CoP.  I think this is significant because STALKER2 is much more refined and detailed ... yet still reeked of the atmosphere and playability that the other games delivered.  I felt as if I was still in the zone.
 
NOTE: I have played all 4 endings, and done 3 ""new"" games in the process.
Yes, I *have* spent 533 hrs playing this game since 21 Nov 2024.  (Please don't judge me!  <8( )
The atmospheric sounds are the same, and they've probably fleshed out some more for the sake of an immersive -- and justified -- player experience.
The horror was not too horrifying!  Yay!  Yet I still felt the same trepidation before stepping into the ""unknown"".  Toward the end-game, my gear was pretty solid, so I felt confident enough to just barge in sometimes and handle the difficulties that arise ... but some encounters may pummel you over and over again if you're not prepped and cautious.

AI always seemed decent to me in the old games, but felt much smarter this time around.  However, not all AI bugs have been ironed out.  Just be patient with them and accept the enemy's occasional ""incompetence"" as a blessing.

The crash bugs have mostly been fixed, so you should have a pretty stable run.  Yes, things got hairy and woeful for a while.  Just forgive it, buy, play, and not regret it.  :D

Much more than the original and mods.  Enjoy!

I have been forced to restart about 4 different times it is actually insane that this game is able to be on the steam marketplace with how broken it is.",negative
Great game that is packed with action!,positive
Perhaps the most good looking game but seriously lacking in other areas. All the skill points went towards visual design not gameplay. It shows HARD and without mods this is unplayable. Very strange for a FPS given how solid the past stalker games where when it came to their strange but decent take on gunplay. ,negative
Bit buggy but a good one,positive
Disappointing,negative
"I rate the game to 2.5/5 with the current 1.2.1 patch. Would have been higher if the game were released with the latest patch changes at the moment of this review. Even so, the game feels incomplete (lots of cut or incomplete content or the lack of more quests for such a huge map or missing features) and buggy (there still lots of issues and need to use workarounds to get past them). I recommend it if you are a fan of the original trilogy like me. If not, wait a year or two when they finish fixing it and release the promised DLC content.

STEAM should allow us to refund this game on a bigger time frame (24 hours instead of just two) and check by themselves if the game is not in a broken and unplayable state before allowing it to be priced and released as a full game. This title is less than a beta or ""early-access"" version and the refund restrictions should not be applied when those games release in such broken and incomplete state.",positive

"Good game living in the skin of a buggy mess. Should've been a great game, and would be so but for the way too many bugs (and some huge bugs, think boss fight at 5fps, among many). Literally the most bug filled game I've ever played, clearly released too early. Also get crashes every 5-30 minutes, seemingly depending on what area of the game I'm in, and luck. The issue iterally redlines to 50GB of my 64GB RAM (the rest is VRAM) and tanks, seemingly a known but not yet fixed memory leak issue? I have a dope PC, so this clearly isn't the issue.

I want to like the game a lot, but it's just so frustrating.

Love This Game,positive
"Im glad this is out. though its kind of scuffed at times. AI will either react instantly. or take their sweet time, they will either be blind and deaf. or have eyes in the back of their head. there is no in between. The Life 2.0 is a bit of a joke. the environment and ambiance are beautiful. that are frequently disrupted by random gunfights, enemy spawns or mutant attacks. its not even dynamic. it just happens. sometimes in the strangest of places. Enemies are excessively tanky, and while efforts have been made to fix this it sometimes is not even noticeable, forget using any intermediate caliber weapon. and i mean anything. unless you want to waste time and ammo. you will dump 3 mags of 5.45 or 5.56 just to kill 1 or 2 enemies. this is especially the case against late game human enemies. and i get theres progression. but gunfights progress from a difficulty curve, to a difficulty spike. chances are if you get ahead of yourself you will die often. Performance is still an issue and calling the game optimized is being optimistic. You will encounter inexpiable drops to sub 10 FPS or worse. pretty sure the lighting has something to do with this due to the way the graphics engine is built. I found you can reduce its frequency by turning the lighting down and motion blur and all the other modern ""graphics"" or rather performance consuming options off. im not gonna lie. you will likely not be able to run all the effects options on high unless you have a super computer, and besides. the game still looks great without them. and your computer is better off without them. 8/10. needs work still",positive
"it requires a few QoL mods but the base game itself is beautiful and well thought out so that the mods really help it shine. While the AI still needs some work (like dogs taking cover when you jump onto a car...like cmon now) firefights are generally good, and areas like the Saturn bunker where you can hear the Bloodsuckers are tense. As a new Stalker, I love the Zone.",positive

Marked one? What the hell?!,positive
"As a long time s.t.a.l.k.e.r. fan, this game has largely been a disappointment. I kept going back after each patch to check in on the progress and was let down every time. It just seems like instead of having the feel of the originals, them switching to unreal engine 5 turned it into just ""another"" mainstream shooter, very arcade-y with a Stalker skin slapped over it. The gameplay / gunplay just doesn't feel right to me, maybe i'm just being nostalgic and letting the love for the originals get the better of me. But besides atmosphere (which is incredible) there really isn't anything amazing about it. The whole game kind of feels like a placeholder or a ""stage"" for something we SHOULD have been getting for a $60+ price tag. ""A-life 2.0"" is just an illusion, feels very tacked on and not fleshed out That's what made the originals great, and the fact they let that out of everything take a nosedive and ""not get it right"" really really sucks. I might come back in the future but right now i need a vacation from the zone of STALKER 2. :(",negative
THE GAME IS THE MOST BADLY OPTIMIZED and UNFINISHED GAME I'VE EVER SEEN,negative
"I can recommend S2:HoC; however, it's a little bipolar/confused in its current state. On my 1 playthrough (Ward, 0 progression bugs during the entire run), here's what I noticed:

S2 falls under a survival umbrella, but presents with too much loot - I had to mod health items out of stashes but still finished with thousands in my chest
The zone is both empty and overpopulated - too many of what should be rare mutants. Hardly any human encounters in the wild, but when you do encounter them, it's army vs army (I would expect lone stalkers or scientists with a merc escort, but never came across loners at all)
The graphics are both amazing and terrible - so much attention to detail and work in creating atmosphere. Things get wet when it rains, various times of day are breathtaking, yet the lighting and shadows are sub par, and reflections can be very hit and miss. Not even mentioning UE5 ghosting etc.
There's every reason to explore, and simultaneously no reason to explore - solving stash puzzles is great fun, but loot in stashes gets more rewarding only when you've basically finished the game and already maxed your gear. Too much mid-game loot is for collectors only - what you find early is only replaced by what you find late.

To get the most out of this game, it begs you to spend hundreds of hours exploring and appreciating, but the main story is best done quickly to avoid forgetting what's going on. As someone who only played vanilla SoC on release, and none of the other titles, HoC does not do enough to develop its characters or make you care for any of them (or remember who they are at various stages of the story). I honestly finished my playthrough doing what I did because I was told to do it, rather than being compelled to achieve the next mission out of a desire to move forward with my characters goals, beliefs and desires.

It goes without saying though, I spent significantly more time on this title than I ever anticipated, and I loved 80% of it. I recommend it for someone who likes to explore and take in the effort and attention to detail. Someone who can overlook the rushed/incomplete aspects and appreciate the bigger picture. S2 has great bones. Hopefully GSC can finish what they started and pave the way to open up even more opportunity for the modding community.",positive
"When I'm not playing STALKER, I think about how fun it is to play STALKER. When I play STALKER, I remember exactly why I don't like playing STALKER.

Gameplay: It's STALKER. There's zero difference between the last ones, this one just has a $60 price tag. Walk from point A to point B, find the item at point B, walk back to point A, then walk back to point B, then walk to point C, find the thing or defeat the enemy at point C, then walk back to point A.
Graphics: Nothing special. Metro Exodus looks better for a game with a similar art style, but is also 6 years older
Performance: I have to run on low to medium to get decent performance. Load times are also pathetic. 
Bugs: No bugs, just a lot of anomalies
Difficulty: Annoying. The game isn't hard, the game just throw random BS with poor design at you and counts that as challenging/immersive game design

I can't recommend this game at full price. If you can find it for less than $40 (I'm being generous), you might as well check it out. Leaving this as not recommended for now.

"After more than a decade we finally got the long awaited sequel of a one of the most atmospheric and iconic postapocalyptic franchise in gaming industry. GSC Gameworld has literally risen from the ashes and delivered title that has nothing but huge ambitions. The question is, can Stalker 2 maintain the legacy of its predecessors and hold up with the modern gameplay mechanics at the same time? The answer is definitely not black or white...
[hr][/hr]
[h3] The Zone [/h3]
I'm not gonna lie. It's an alpha & omega of the whole game. That's the reason why thousands of player keeps returning to this franchise after all these years. The Zone in Stalker 2 combines all the areas from the previous games plus adds some new ones. The areas are very divers and most of them has its unique vibe and most importantly its secrets and mysteries. The Zone is well crafted piece of art which successfully avoids the genericity of the modern open worlds. Once you are exploring an anomaly which takes place in a beautiful sunny landscape then you are fighting through the gloomy but somehow charming abandoned soviet industrial object. Basically, every step you make you come across something interesting and worth to explore because there is always something hidden. It might be great loot, rare artifact, easter egg or just magnificent view.

[h3] Exploration & Loot [/h3]
It's the one of the most essential thing you can and you had better do. Exploring the world around you is a key how to make your life in The Zone easier and to be honest much more enjoyable. Because if you go straight line you are going to miss a lot and I mean a lot of stuff that you can use to survive, to boost your equipment up or just for sale. Loot is everything in the zone and the more dangerous place you manage to seek the more rewarding weapon or equipment you will probably find. Very entertaining part of a game is definitely the artifact hunting. The anomalies which keep artifacts are quite challenging and it's harsh to avoid its deadly power to catch that bouncy little shinny thing that can make you a fortune. 
But god, I really don't like looting corpses of a fallen humans. In the most cases the enemies you pin down to the ground have a jack sh*t in their pockets. And it doesn't matter how tough fight it was to kill them. It feels kinda odd because a minute ago the enemy had an unlimited amount of ammo which was firing towards yours crumbled body shell.

[h3] Guns & Gear [/h3]
Guns are just something. They feel so real. The animations, the look, the sound they make, the impact you can feel through the monitor, well that is a top notch experience. And I appreciate the fact that it's necessary to take care of your weapons and gear. It gives another layer into that survival element. It encourages you to gain resources to keep your sh*t in a best shape. Because if you don't you won't kill even the weakest nut job you bump into. You can bet your pants on that.
But I have a big problem with repair costs especially during the early game. Give you an example. I took a side quest and I finished it. During the quest my gear took some damage which was expected. But the reward from quest giver was far too low that it barely covered the repair costs. It's not pleasant at all but someone can say, this is The Zone...

[h3] Game design & quests [/h3]
This is the most crucial flaw of a whole game. Don't get me wrong, it's not all that bad but ain't brilliant either. Most of the quest feels like trapped in the past decade. You have to go from point A to point B, turn something off or on and get back. Afterwards, you have to go to point C, speak with someone, go elsewhere to bring something back. That's the classic quest loop. Like I said it isn't necessarily a bad thing but the thing is that the progression of quests feels quite dull from time to time. Several times I caught myself with lack of motivation to finish the quest and I was wondering what am I even doing here? 
Sad thing is that the game isn't scary enough though. Although, the underground levels got some creepy atmosphere there is a lack of horror over all. I'm person which is very easy to be scared but in this case it somehow didn't work at all. Maybe it is because of the fire power I had or funny looking mutants. Or maybe I've just grown up and jump scares doesn't work on me anymore.
There is another aspect which sometimes kills the flow of game progress. It's nothing else than the long travel distances between the quest waypoints. Yes, you can take it as an opportunity to loot some undiscovered places but since you have running out of inventory space, travelling is just boring a far to slow. I couldn't be able to count the number of Nonstop cans I drank... Would be nice to see the statistics :)  

[h3] Mutants & Human enemies [/h3]
Another aspect that is far behind its potential. If I'm not wrong, there is no new mutant species and they are all the same like in the old games. This is such a let down because the current mutant portfolio is kinda plain and nothing surprised me at all. I admire the level of devs loyalty to original games but this is pure waste of opportunity to do something more engaging.
Even the behaviour of a mutants like a Chimera or Pseudogiant is just dull and easy to exploit. Shame that there is no progression during fights with those beasts at all. Imagine the boss fight progression similar to Dark Souls. It would be nuts!
Human enemies are just OK nothing more nothing less. The AI has gone through serious downgrade in contrast with old Stalker games and it kinda disrupts game immersion but I can live with it.   
 
[h3] Plot [/h3]
The story is overall definitely interesting, engaging and full of surprises. But it's also overwhelming to say the least. So there are parts of the story when I was completely lost and wasn't really sure what I'm doing. There is no journal or summary of current objectives so if you loss some important dialog you have no other option than read it from context of upcoming events. By the way some dialogs are very easy to miss because they pops up during tough fights via radio. I don't have time to chat when I'm fighting moron! Anyway, during the story progression some answers was revealed but I still have some holes in a plot even though I finished the game ([spoiler] Strelok's ending btw. [/spoiler]). But I have a feeling that all of this was on purpose and devs want me to feel like that, like a puppet. The story is about heavy conspiracies and mind control after all.

[h3] Technical state & Graphics [/h3]
The game is still mess in some ways. It's bugged as hell and I was not able to complete an important side quest because of bugged counter of items I had to collect. Thanks for not allowing me that achievement! Even other achievements are bugged and not popping up when it should. UI is also broken, sometimes it's to dark, sometimes it flickers and it makes me wanna vomit, literally. Conversations are bugged as well, sometimes you just stare into nothing meanwhile keep chatting. And there is a lot more...
Graphics is pretty nice and some scenery are the best you can see in video games. However there is a lot inconsistency in visuals so some areas look obsolete and ugly. And of course it's UE5 game so there is visual noise everywhere and the performance on a pretty decent computer is very poor.
[hr][/hr]
I have had a great times during playing Stalker 2. It is very ambitious and engaging game and without a doubt it has a high production value even though it's eastern european title. It has great potential but some obsolete features holding it back. Bugs can be fixed, but clunkiness in game design is almost impossible to improve. I wish that this game would have more time to be polished, because it would be much better title than it is right now.

7/10",positive
Watered down unpolished and cheap feeling. The graphics are great and the story is interesting but the game is not worth the price tag. Low quality.,negative
"It's very disappointing how people behave, that this game is a Masterpiece, worthy of leading the franchise and being mentioned. That's simply, not true in any way shape and form. After 15 years this game was released, and after 15 years it's missing, every single thing that made STALKER the games we love and replay today.

I'll start with most important, for me, which is Lore. In games I love lore, it's what connects me to the game, it's what gives me reason to play and be interested.
The lore in Stalker 2 just really sucks ass, and it's so badly, limply attached to the Original games, it's depressing.
Cliche story line of the main character that gets the McGuffin item that solves the problem, or is the key to everything in existing situation. Our character Skif, receives a piece of the Monolith crystal, that somehow travels all the way from Chernobyl, to his place of residency destroying his apartment. Despite the fact that..artifacts in lore and the games, are found in anomalies with the mixture of their surroundings, radiation, material and weather, to create a specific artifact. In lore it's UNHEARD of, for an artifact, to fly from one point, to another, especially out of the zone, because it would loose all it's aspects and abilities.
If that's not much of a cliche, here's another, the biggest foothold in the zone, holds the Ward, and main scientist, is in the zone, not for reasearch, not for the better of human kind, but to find his father, who worked on the C-Conc. Another cliche is a uber soldier boss battle, because, stalker is so famous and known for boss battles, having to fight a powered up, exo skeleted with blast protection shields with a couple of waves, fantastic I know.
But that's not the only one, for each ending, there will be two maybe three boss battles..because, yeah. Other games do it.

So you have a story Line that has nothing to do with previous games, leaving crumbs and bits of previous lore, just so it could say it's a continuation, let's talk about Factions.

Factions have been completely butchered, original factions tossed aside, to forefront the new factions and subfactions that are..so disappointing and were absolutely needless, but to support the boss battles in the end or better say, different ending choices.

Loners, the people zone is mostly consisted off, people who scavenge, explore, find, have been reduced to mere standard residents that don't travel much else above cordon, Lesser zone or anywhere else, because, well the Ward says so. The Ukranian Military was replaced with another multi big word company, because, yeah. Duty has been reduced to shit, having the most close ideal as the military, they were turned against, reduced to shit, and it's ground was given to Freedom beacuse, to stop the conflict apparently. And let me repeat, the Ward and new name for military, sided, with freedom, the people who want to open the zone for everyone, that it's a gift to mankind, instead of Duty, who are the opposite, want everything in the zone to stay in the zone, destroy it because of it's danger.
Alright, what about Bandits? You'll find them the most around, alive and well, kicking, attacking you on sight, some minimal missions around them, nothing fantastic, because somehow Bandits managed to get a firmer hold in the zone, rather than the Loners, or Duty, or fuck even Freedom.
Mercs? Redcuced to dust, apparently the border guards thought the issue in the zone weren't mutants, people who want to open the zone, literal bandits and criminals, but Mercenaries, who are there to make money off of jobs like escorts, assasinations or artifact hunting. That's much worse.
Monolith, was of course used to teach Skif who they were, oho look we're not evil aha here i go brainwashed again, and they start killing people again. Strider, who was a character that survived in the OG trilogy, was killed off, in the most disappointed, most wasteful way, made me fucking angry.

Gunplay in the game sucks absolute ass, after 15 years, after so many games they could've seen what people like, mostly now people enjoy real weapons with realistic behavior, modding is a plus always, they decided, fuck all that. A 9mm SMG will out preform a rifle caliber AR sometimes even a sniper rifle, the only dominating weapon being the Gauss rifle. Oh you would like to use weapons you like, just like in OG games? Well..too bad chief, if you don't want a naked stalker to take a headshot and live..better stick to that meta weapon with higher damage and pen. Weapon modification and choice is just..depressing, won't even want to talk about it, it's not even worth it.

A-Life, ah yes, the thing that put STALKER on the map, the most fantastic thing ever made, is nowhere to be seen in Stalker 2. For you fandom tourists, A-Life is a system original stalker games had. Basically Human and Mutant NPCs lived active lives in the zone, with genuine tasks and reasons to stay in the zone. Mutants would actively hunt when hungry, drag corpses to a spot to eat, or fall back if there are more enemies than they can fight. Sometimes mutants wouldn't attack you..if you simply avoided their territory, where they would growl, stomp and warn you to stay away. Stalkers, of each faction, would complete faction specific tasks. Loners would hunt mutants and hunt artifacts. Duty would do patrols and hunt mutants, Mercenaries would go around killing people or hunting artifacts, Bandits would sneak around or mug people.
And all of this, happened outside of your vision. All of it, reduced to code, as it happened on the other side of the map.



I'll stop assing and get to the point. The Original games, made you feel just another person in the zone. Your actions weren't out of this world, you weren't the all knowing all powerful being. You were another stalker in the zone, with your won path you learned through your actions. You weren't given anything at arms length and you earned everything.
Original stalker games didn't act like we were retarded, and needed everything explained like to a child.
Stalker games are about dread, hopelessness and survival in the literal hell on earth. And we loved it. Learning how each faction managed to survive, how they get by, and what would be the best choice for us.

Stalker 2 is missing all of it. We're just another cliche protagonist who's be all end all, his saying meaning everything. Skif is the one who got the artifact, skif is the one who would help with every problem, skif is the one that can hunt down any problem, skif is the answer, to everything.

We were never the answer to anything. We were simply a character that had a answer. Strelok researched the zone when C-Conc made a mistake, so he eventually came to and made his way back. Scar was there to stop Strelok, lied to by the Clear Sky higher ups, that were just C-Conc scientists, trying to hide everything and get close, to muddy the waters. Degtaryev was a military man, who came to find answers, and he did.

Not one man was holding all the answers, three men, held the fraction. But we apparently can get everything, and anything.

"Honestly a really great game even with some bugs here or there I know a lot of people have said they were having issues with bugs but I was fine for the most part. I had a few crashes and saw some miner visual glitches. My one beef with this game is about a minor story spoiler but [spoiler] Why can't I save Spirit? And why did the Ward only steal the Regenerator from me when they imprisoned me? After I saw it was that I no longer had it in my inventory I just thought i didn't need it so the game got rid of it, but when I met Spirit I realized that I could Have helped him. I thought it was a glitch at first but I looked online and it seems you can only give the Regenerator to him by siding with the Ward. I don't even know why the Ward would want the Regenerator which is what bothers me the most! [/spoiler] Other than that great game!",positive
"This game should've been released as pre-alpha!

i'm playing this game on a RTX2080 8GB and it plays great with little frame drops when i reach bases. my setting are on medium and it look great!

i have had the worst bugs and some of the missions don't even complete and because of those issues and it just makes me think about most games these days. the developer of the STALKER series is known to be a very sloppy when it comes to bugs and crashes. if they have really been working on this game for 15 years then it should never need any fixer updates or they must put in really bad hours of work time or have no care but to take your cash.

i really want to say great things but this game i an up hill battle with its problems. i feel bad for the 6 million players stuck in the buggy zone.

i do recommend this game to people with heaps of patience with bugs, glitches and crashing!",positive

"Real mixed bag here. 

Stalker 2 is absolutely gorgeous, despite some expected UE5 problems. I loved exploring every inch of the map and getting into gunfights. The minute to minute gameplay didn't get old.

Unfortunately, this game is incredibly buggy and broken, particularly the horrendous endgame mission which is full of nonsense and crashed four times before I could finish it. Enemy variety is lacking, and the missions are generally pretty formulaic and uninspired. I hope they continue patching the game and improving it, because it still needs a lot of work. I can't exactly recommend it, but overall I'm happy I played it.",positive
"the optimization is absolute cheeks


you'd have better luck trying to clear a literal minefield than try to make this game run smoothly",negative
Great game. Immersive and atmospheric as hell. Best in the series for me.,positive
"The good:
- Beautiful world, both graphically and the attention to detail.
- Realistic and immersive weather.
- Great music and audio design (besides some very strange, but rare audio bugs).
- Solid gunplay, killing enemies is satisfying.
- Lots of spooky moments and areas.
- Challenging even on normal difficulty.

The bad:
- Antiquated game design.
- Hit or miss voice acting (mostly miss except for some of the main characters).
- Poorly written dialogue (for the most part).
- One dimensional characters.
- Boring side quests.
- Boring character progression.
- Boring loot.
- Half-baked survival and stealth mechanics.
- Bad AI.
- Literal running simulator with extremely limited stamina (you spend at least 50% of your play time running from map marker to map marker).
- Really bad memory leak (your game randomly freezes and your RAM usage goes to 100%, forcing you to restart the game - hopefully you saved recently).

Overall, this game is pretty bad and I regret buying it. It really just seems like a massive missed opportunity. The art team did an amazing job, but most of the other teams failed miserably, particularly the writers, voice actors, quest designers and systems designers. The story was decent and dealt with some interesting philosophical questions, but unfortunately it was ruined by an endless amount of super boring filler missions that just drag on and on and on. It could have been half as long and would have been a better game. Also, the ending that I got didn't make sense in multiple ways and was the exact opposite of the goal I thought I was working towards for most of the game. 

If you really want to play this, you should wait for a big sale. But I would recommend skipping it entirely.",negative

"Game is just an Unreal walking simulator tech demo, still no real A-Life",negative
ugh,negative
"[h1]Not quite there yet...[/h1]

A waste of time and money even after several months of waiting for patches.
So many irritating choices like mutants that can stagger for free.

The open world isn't the typical UbisoftLand design however in terms of player agency it has almost nothing to offer.
Near to zero emergent gameplay elements that could let players craft their own little adventures in the Zone. As a consequence, the world feels very static despite having some form of npc spawning here and there.

No faction system, no henchman nor companion, no intertwinded or reactive systems. 
(How about a territory warfare system tied to factions for example? Caravans seeking escorts and impacting local economy? Unique NPCs that roam the land?)


So for the most part the game becomes a streched out walking simulator that doesnt even have an auto run keybind.
And the more one's towards the end, the more visible the lack of testing / debugging.

Atmosphere, lore, gunplay and some set pieces are on the positive side of things though.
All in all, does not live up to the Zone of old... 
Subsequent patches and mods might reveal the game's true potential, but that's a big if.

"TLDR - I played all the originals, loved them, and this one is by far my fav of them all. 

After playing through the game completely (v1.0) and seeing all these negative reviews even after the updates, this had lead me to make a review. I typically never leave reviews but I must say I really enjoyed this game. I also played all 3 of the previous stalker titles. This game captures the zone beautifully with unreal engine 5. The anomalies look so life like, the reloading animations can bring you to orga**. The combat is fun and rewarding, and also feel like it does offer a challenge. The story is there if you want it but honestly not really needed. I personally enjoyed the story and it drove the game well. 

Its really annoying seeing people say this game is bad due to technical issues. Yes, it does have a lot of issues, honestly, but comparing it to the original 3 in a bad way in this manner is silly. The original trilogy had its fair share of problems. The Xray engine was not very stable. Not to mention, if you are willing to play a game from the 00s (which can be a little wonky compared to today's standards, you shouldn't have a problem with this modern title whatsoever. Saying the AI is better in the older titles is true in some cases but not completely. In clear sky, just about every AI would hide behind cover and toss a grenade.. Every single combat engagement. I will say, the whole A-Life system was definitely better in the original, however, what I'm trying to say is that, all of the games have their issues, and so comparing doesn't really say anything. 

Overall, I loved the game, the story, the characters, and especially the gameplay. The anomalies were fun, the mutants were horrifying, the gunplay was very rewarding, and the atmosphere was really cool and looks way better than the original games (naturally).

Good game,positive
"I started playing S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games last year, 2024, after completing the trilogy from 2007-08-09 I bought this as I was very thrilled to play it from the first teaser, once I finally beat it, it's time for a review.

PROS:
- Graphics;
- Atmosphere (to me no other games including my favourites managed to get a sense of atmosphere like Stalker 2);
- The concept idea behind combat which is somehow realistic.

 and unfortunately that's it.

CONS:
- Optimization
- Audio issues (some things were silent like enemies movement, enemies dying etc...)
- Clipping bugs (getting shot through walls due to enemy being glitched inside the wall)
- Combat: even with armor pen/skin pen bullets, it feels like everything is a bulletsponge, especially mutants
- Enemy spawn: even after the important patches I still got some enemies popping in front of me silently and got nearly killed by them.
- Shaders compiling: wish it wasn't there for each game start (I know it can be turned off but the game wouldn't run properly like that)

Things I would have added if I was in the dev team: some sort of point of interests for fast travel or more travelling friendly guides around to save TONS of time walking.

Overall, the story is really cool and the game is fun, but playing it everytime and facing at least one of the problems from the CONS section felt really disappointing. I am also aware of the situation with the dev team, but once a product is released it should be in a better state. I still recommend it!",positive
They really pulled it off. There's always things to nit-pick about but its truly a beautiful experience and blows many AAA games out of the water. The devs put their heart and soul into this in an environment where many others are out for a soulless cash grab. Thanks GSC. You did great,positive

"A decent game held back by many issues, Stalker 2 ends up being the worst entry in the series and inferior to the original trilogy in every sense except graphics. The original trilogy was awesome because you explore, you discover the story of what happened to the world and its inhabitants instead of a marker telling you ""Go here, go there"" like a shopping list in a grocery store. The essence of the franchise is gone, your choices have less weight and the map is designed to make you waste time by giving you a ""walk here 6 km"" for every quest in the midgame. Traders disappear, whole cities are disabled and if you don't join the WARD in the story, you are GOING TO HAVE A BAD TIME as the game is designed to punish you greatly in every way if you don't join the ward by losing access to areas and resources.

All of this without talking about the bugs and glitches. I suffered from having to lose hours of progress cause an NPC wouldn't show up in the main quest no matter what. I had to reload because the HUD keeps disappearing because you can walk in a swamp and suddenly drown 20 feet down. They excited you with monsters like Chimera only to have an emission every time (is an event where you go underground or you die) which means events are SCRIPTED. Like what happened? Where is the magic of Stalker? What is this lazy beta that feels unfinished, unpolished, and long for the sake of being long (walk those 6KM Skif! WALK!) Add to this memory leaks and optimization that is embarrassing and... wow.

I like the gunplay, is fun and the guns are pretty good, the graphics of them plus the world is beautiful. This game had the making to be decent/good if it was baked for another year or two. Enemy spawns on top of you, enemies never miss a shot even being miles away and mutant AI is a joke, they are dumb. You can jump on a truck or a barrel and mutants will just stay there doing nothing. They are just bullet sponges designed to make you waste ammo (I like psy dog tho). The story is all over the place, with Skif just randomly being treated like the most trustworthy ally and a traitor at the same time. The carry capacity is awful,your choice between being slow and full of ammo or being fast and lacking ammo.

The OG trilogy is better in every aspect (except graphics) so if you are new you might want to check them instead. Awesome games and can be bundled for almost the same price as this if memory serves right. If you are looking to get into Stalker 2, either wait for more fixes, or go in with the expectation that you are gonna lose progress, you are gonna get bugs and glitches, you are gonna have to reload a LOT, and you are going to have to walk 6 km daily on an atrocious map design. There is a decent game buried here around somewhere, but I couldn't keep up with the chore gameplay to find and chances are, you will not either. The early game is enjoyable, mid game is a chore, late game is suffering.",negative

Graphics - demanding, gorgeous, and next gen.
Audio - Music and sound effects fit perfectly.
Combat - good as any other open world title.
Story - believable, interesting, and poetic justice to the title.
World - LARGE, atmospheric, persistent.

HIGHLY Recommend mods to balance: Energy, combat, stamina, climbing.

Quests seem to be nothing more than walking sims, always seem to be over burdened making credits is a bore as it's constant back and forth to a few traders spots on the map.
Can't give it a positive review in the current state, i've given up on the game without completing it out of boredom and hope this is a a Cyberpunk situation where it will become what everyone expected the game to be by the first DLC release",negative

"The good; Story, characters, cut scenes (good movie)

The bad; Poorly optimized, buggy, and -5 innovation (but those graphics tho!!!)

The ugly; Stalker was supposed to be an RPG like any other, once upon a time. Now, can we even qualify this as an RPG? Exp system? Companions? Unique side quests? Crafting?  This game is aggressively linear and the lack of an exp system is the biggest offender imo. (also minecraft has better combat)

Conclusion; just download ""Stalker: Anomolies"", its a free standalone mod of ""Call of Pripyat"". Good Hunting

"Firstly, I am a big STALKER fan, purchased all the original games on CD when released and then again on Steam. 

I pre-ordered this game (Ultimate Edition) when announced and didn't refund even with all the delays, unfortunately, it just isn't that good (should/could have been good), it's just too broken, too many bugs, currently unable to continue the main storey line due to a bug (very frustrating), side quest issues (unable to complete due to bugs), bored of the many mundane stashes (many need to contain better items [unbroken guns, attachments, armours, have duplicate blueprints throughout the map so you can find the same blueprint but in different locations], need to be able to fast track to other locations with stalkers you meet whilst exploring the zone (too much walking/running on your own) just to make it more interesting. 

Hopefully it will improve with the updates and DLC, but people who have purchased the game and waited shouldn't have these issues. 

Sad to say but not recommended in it's current form, hopefully it will improve in time.",negative
"Finished the game after about 60 hours. Stalker 2 has been one of the best singleplayer FPS games I have played in many years. It is one of the few games I have felt like playing all the way through since Skyrim. Graphics are great and gameplay is a lot of fun. The story is hard to understand and characters you meet through the story are not very deep. It feels like no one really matters. The main story line is weak compared to other games like bioshock series or metro series, but the gameplay, combat and exploration is very fun and is what makes stalker 2 such a great game. After the updates the game has recived so far the game has improved a lot but there is still some janky stuff in the game. 

What i don't like about stalker 2 is that the last ""city"" pripyat is not really open until the very last segment of the game, but to me is the most interesting part of the game as it is a big city to explore with though enemies but great loot. I wish the whole map was open to every player right out of the gate so you could ""play how you like to play"" as it restricts the concept of open world. the beginning of the game is fun and refreshing but eventually enemies become bullet sponges and there is a lot of them, not only is there a lot of enemies, but a lot of the same enemies. I wish there were more mutants/anomalies to encounter, more side missions that had more meaning in the playthrough/character building. When reaching the end of the game it also feels like you are restricted to a few weapons because of how much damage the enemies can take so you are not able to play how you like with the weapons you like. I could go on with the imperfections of the game

All in all Stalker 2 has been a great playthrough minus the bugs. Im excited to see what the modding community can do with the game. In the state the game is in now i can highly recommend the game for anyone that likes Singleplayer FPS games, compared to Metro series, Bioshock series, Fallout and Far cry. I give the game 8/10. -1 for the story line and characters, and -1 for variety of playability and enemies. Bugs im not to worried about as they were not game breaking for me, and the devs have done a lot to improve the game. You still need a high end PC to run super smoothly though.",positive

"I am going to give this game a very tentative recommendation for players who enjoyed the original series. My observations are the following:

Good: 
-As in the original trilogy, the atmosphere is fantastic. I did not have any graphical or technical issues to detract from being able to wander around the zone and look at the amazing set pieces (e.g. tornado or Duga). 

-The voice acting is decent. I would say it alternates between being well done and capturing the emotion of poignant moments in the game and being overwrought or overstaying its welcome (me thinks Scar's soliloquy should be a bit shorter...)

-The gun play and variety of weapons is satisfying on veteran difficulty, but not great.

-The gameplay loop and combat can be surprisingly fun.

Bad:
-The plot is way too convoluted. This is exacerbated by the aforementioned overwrought voice acting that sometimes exaggerates the emotional layers in scenes. I think they do this for emphasis but it's cloying at times. At one point it just felt like one ""shock twist"" after another (he's a C-agent, no HE'S a C-agent, no HEEEE'S a C-agent).

-While the gun play and combat are generally good, the bosses are atrocious bullet sponges and the hitscan enemies can be unbelievably frustrating, especially at higher levels. Shotguns loaded with buckshot should not be inflicting bleeding and big damage from 300 yards away.

-Gun progression makes absolutely no sense and differences in damage between firearms is totally arbitrary due to the penetration mechanic. An AKM should not do vastly reduced damage compared to firearms that fire the exact same cartridge.

-The repair mechanics are frustratingly expensive. I understand that they probably tweaked this as a coupon-sink so players would have something of a resource constraint, but it doesn't work. By the end of the game I still had an enormous stockpile of the best weapons and ammunition, yet still had to constantly repair gear. It makes no sense for a rifle's condition to be degraded by 20% after firing two magazines.

-The last gauntlet is so frustrating that I almost uninstalled the game. It's not even fun. It's just a slog against hitscan enemies with shields that can literally shoot through walls.

-The mission variety is nonexistent (all fetch quests) and can be frustrating because you just find yourself running from one point to another on the map. And the map is huge.

-While I didn't encounter many technical issues, there were a number of gamebreaking bugs that necessitated repeated reloads of past save files. This got frustrating, but is pretty commonplace in games these days.

Overall:
I think the atmosphere and positive qualities of the game outweigh its weaknesses. That said, there are multiple endings but I only did one because the last section of the game is so tedious and I didn't have the interest in trying for the others. It's generally clear what side you're choosing.

For players who did not enjoy the original series, I'd stay clear. A big part of what drew me in was the nostalgia of being able to revisit the atmosphere of the zone and see the stories of the original characters play out to completion. That said, I would purchase an expansion/DLC if they produce one.

"Im ashamed to have put so much time  in this game. The truth is that i spent 100 hours+ trying to fix it with mods and I finally had an epiphany while walking my dog between two modded test builds that I was working on : This game is not a Stalker game because it is broken at its core. This game never felt like a Stalker game since I have started playing it and it never will. Yes, all of the other games of the franchise were a buggy mess at launch but at least they were made with passion, this just felt like an insult to the consumers. It is not normal to have an open world that feels MORE boring and dead than an 18 year old game of the SAME franchise.

Basically :  the story is confusing, the world is boring, the graphics just dont feel right like especially when youre inside a building and youre looking outside and its just plain white and blinding you because MUH UE5 PHOTOREALISM, the headshot sound is like an ADHD CoD type multiplayer game like Fortnite sound or whatever, the AI is terrible, the mutants arent really scary anymore, they are just a chore and just a pain in the ass to deal with especially cause the it feels cheap, half of all the quests are really boring, the UI art style just looks like a Ubisoft games UI asset they found and I could go on and on and on but ultimately I thought the game felt really outdated. 

It was CLEARLY dumbed down for the console market. The franchise used to be one of the reasons why some people would get into PC gaming and now it just look like another generic far cry clone.

It is not normal for players to have to download tons of quality of life mods to make the game feel like a real 2025 AAA game.

I tried modding it a few times but I think it is just fundamentally broken gameplay wise. I am incredibly disappointed in GSC for that one and I really think they should be ashamed of that release.

I really hope that one day, video game studios will take accountability for that type of stupid decisions that are becoming the norm in the industry since the past 10 years.",negative

the enemies weapons spray pattern and accuracy is actually f**ked.

Besides that to fully play this game without crashing and having to restart you'll have to break into NASA headquarters and hijack their servers. This game is a perfect example of 2 things the ukraine does great which is making a immersive storyline/series and making an even crappier product to leach off a succesful franchise.,negative

"As a longtime fan of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. franchise, I was excited to dive into this Slavic shooter and its unique brand of AI. The series’ innovative AI, reminiscent of F.E.A.R., set the bar high in 2007, and even the heavily-modded games held up in the 2020s. 

S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2, however, falls short of its predecessors.

While the atmosphere and graphics of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 are impressive, the AI and unexpected gameplay that defined the original trilogy are nowhere to be found. Alife 2.0, marketed as the sequel to the original's A-life 1.0, is little more than an enemy spawner with no persistence or meaningful impact on the game.

As a life long fan of the series, this game feels like a hollow tribute.

Unless GSC can deliver on the promised A-life 2.0, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 will never live up to the legacy of its predecessors. Only old school fans will understand the depth and complexity that's missing from this game.

The gunplay is phenomenal and tense and scary, the world is 10/10, and it's even better if you turn off the crosshair and set english subtitles but ukranian for the voice language. makes the dialogue feel less stiff.

[h1][u]HOWEVER.[/u][/h1]

This is a game that had heart and soul [i]poured[/i] into it by everyone who worked on it, and it shows. Locations from previous games are almost exactly as remembered, but updated for modern graphics; meanwhile real-world landmarks can be found oftentimes by following loose real-world directions when it comes to the inside of buildings (ex: the firefighters' clothes in the basement of the Prypiat hospital.) The lore is lovingly paid attention to in several ways, with threads connecting to every previous S.T.A.L.K.E.R. title in manners both major and miniscule (the location your stash contents were dumped in Call of Prypiat, for instance, is a place you can find and there is a small amount of loot there, while characters such as the rookie you save in Shadow of Chornobyl have their fate revealed in a small side quest.)

All in all—if this is your first S.T.A.L.K.E.R. title? It is still being polished, but I feel it's well worth it. If you're a veteran stalker, returning to the zone?

"I am recommending this game only because it is similar to a few of my favorite RPGs/shooters ever, for better or worse.

For better: 
STALKER reminds me of Fallout 3/NV, Far Cry 2, and the Witcher 3 for the open world you get to explore and how your choices impact the game (some exception here for Fallout 3 and FC2). All of these games, like STALKER, give you a detailed, interesting world you'll want to explore, and gameplay systems you'll have fun learning to understand. For gamepad users such as myself, having a STALKER game with native gamepad support is a delicacy. There's a little less content, main and side quest-wise, than the Witcher 3. Many of the side quests are things you'll stumble across while exploring. Some areas have little puzzles that will reward you with a unique weapon, like said Fallout games. I was very sucked into this game for the first 100 hours (my total playtime between Game Pass and here would be 184 hours, but I'll get into that later) and there's not many games that suck me in like that. I'm older now, I've played a lot of not games and am not easily impressed, but STALKER pulled it off. If only...

It did NOT remind me of said 3 games in all the worst ways too:
It is extremely buggy. With ambition usually comes areas that could have been tested more. It was buggier before the update when I was playing on Game Pass. Many quests in the main questline REQUIRED me to use console commands (which are not native to the game) to be able to progress. I remember this happening at least 4 times, most were in the Garbage area. Yes, that early on and if I had been playing on Xbox that would be it. Game over. Not cool, GSC. The game needed more time in the oven, obviously. 
After the update dropped, my game froze (shocker, right?). It wasn't a hard freeze that required me to hold in the power button, only sign out of Windows and sign back in. When I signed in and got back to the main menu, there was no continue option. My gut sank. My worst fears confirmed. ALL my saves became corrupted, with 101 hours lost... I concluded this was a Game Pass issue, so I bought it on Steam. With the latest patch live (writing this as of 3/3/2025) I managed to get a full playthrough in without using a console command for any quests, so progress is being made. However, the game still freezes up, a lot. It reminds me of how much (but not as much overall) New Vegas froze on my PS3. But at least New Vegas never corrupted all my save files, only one. STALKER 2 still has a long way to go to make this game more stable. While we're speaking of stable, lets talk about frame rate! While the game looks great, it runs like crap. In populated areas your frame rate will tank. I tested multiple configurations of settings in what I feel is one of the hardest areas to render, Rostok, and couldn't lift my frame rate to 60 fps no matter what without using God-awful frame-gen which generates massive screen tearing. And I HATE screen tearing so frame-gen is a no go. It didn't matter if I played on 4k/Epic or 720p/low, I couldn't get the frame rate to 60 fps in Rostok, in fact, it nearly stayed the same. I checked resource usages and nothing was maxed out yet the frame rate struggled. It's a game problem, apparently.

So, take the best of the best and the worst of the worst, you have STALKER 2. If you're willing to tolerate a half-cooked game that *may* corrupt all your saves and has lots of bugs while freezing from time to time (certain areas seem to be much worse than others) you'll enjoy a game that is original, painful-yet-rewarding (like Far Cry 2), and has what I consider to be a great story while having nothing DEI-ridden or woke about it.

------

Amazing game and impressive S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game! Some players blame this game for clunkiness, bugs or poor graphics / world / story in comparison to OG trilogy, but it's not true. Try it out yourself and you'll see how it all really is:
* huuuge map with hundreds of unique POIs and side quests,
* a lot of new locations,
* an incredible retouch of the old locations,
* new mechanics including animations and AAA cutscenes (just rewind how all that looked like in the old games lol),
* stealth that really works finally,
* reputation among the factions in the Zone,
* last but definitely not the least - layered and complex story with several unexpected endings (and with different playable sides of the conflict). The UE5 has it's downsides, but damn Nanite and Lumen make the game look insanely good!

The game exceeds all expectation in all ways and expands the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. own universe to the limits. It's definitely a huge improvement making the game a great successor to the previous titles in the series and it'll take you for a long journey if you're the fan.

The release version was not as stable ofc, but a few months later it's way-way better experience - and the devs plan to continue the support (e.g. releasing the A-life the way it meant to be).

"6/10 with a lot of potential
(100 % MSQ)
This game was a constant up and down. At times I was impressed, but many times I was extremely annoyed with the gameplay design. However, it is obvious that the entire development team put a lot of effort into this game.
It was my first Stalker Game.

[b]Positive points:[/b]
- Great cutscenes / cinematics
- Great character design
- Great voice actors (I used the original ukrainian voice actors + english subtitle)
- Some great world design - Prypjat in particular looks very realistic, which gave me an immersive feeling
- The story is good - especially because of the many different possible decisions you can make that have an impact on the subsequent quests and thus the finale

[b]Negative points:[/b]
- The design of the mutants is very poor - it looks more silly than scary
- The shootouts in the MSQ are mostly about shooting 5 trillion bullets into 2 trillion enemies until you're out of ammo or your weapons are broken (which happens very often and way too fast)
- The ‘boss’ fights in the  MSQ were the worst experience I've ever had in games that feature ‘boss’ fights - same here: it's all about shooting all your ammo into them
- The effects of the open world anomalies are very poorly designed - whether you're spinning around in a whirlwind for 2 seconds or getting hit by lightning or fire, with no other consequences or nice effects - it just feels like a stopgap
- This game is purely a walking simulator during the MSQ. It was terrible. Some people argued: that's because you're supposed to explore the world! Well, yes, but to be honest, there wasn't too much to explore.
->>> The map is freaking huge, but the loot pool is incredibly poor.
->>> You find hidden stashes as you explore, but 99% of them are MedKits, sausages, ammo, vodka, energy drinks and bread. It was outrageous. I've never seen a loot pool this bad in an open world exploration game.
->>> When you walk around for 30-60 minutes, the map feels extremely empty. Sometimes you meet a few thieves, but you don't want to fight them because there is literally NO reward other than vodka, bread and ammo.
->>> If you find weapons or gear in stashes, you already own way better stuff
 - The game turned out to be much more science fiction than I ever imagined - it was definitely inspired by the Matrix films, which made me smirk.
- Unfortunately, the game also had some bugs that prevented you from progressing in the main story quests. Workarounds helped - but once I had to completely load another save file and change my previous choices in the MSQ to get a new exit and storyline in the MSQ

Unfortunately, I was very relieved when I finished the MSQ. Sure some people will love it, and I can see the passion and potential the developers have put into it, but there is so much missing.

Love this game. Would definitely look forward to a Stalker 3!,positive

Amazing game,positive
"Went to some place killed whole squad of bandits and all they had in their hiding place was redbull can 10/10. Best redbull I had, apart from that part where it gave me cancer.",positive
broken and runs terribly but I mean I had fun,positive
"If you played the original, you'll love the the maps as it brings everything back to life.
If you never played before, be ready to immerse yourself in the zone where your actions will determine what will happen at the end.",positive
"It is a good game. Sure there are bugs and teething issues, and it ends up being a bit of stash hunt sometimes, but all in all it is good. I'm kind of weirded out by the random american, Irish and cockney accents in the zone, but given the real world development of the game being interrupted by an actual war, I think we can all live with that. 

There are new features and anomolies, and loads more artifacts. Yes gameplays mechanics have changed a bit since CoP, but all in all the game is pretty fun, and it has a lot of the old areas to explore in new ways. It is a bit like a nostalgia trip sometimes, especially in Zaton!",positive

"combat is just unbearable, not only no hit indicator, enemies are not only bullet sponges (even on easiest difficulty) but they never stagger or flinch! you never know if you hit the enemy or not which makes combat stale, boring and frustrating!",negative

Devs need to fix performance and stuttering and A-Life then this will be a great game,negative
"STALKER 2: Heart of Chernobyl looks like it’s shaping up to be an incredible return to the Zone. The atmosphere, survival mechanics, and AI-driven world seem to build on what made the original games so unique. Every encounter feels unpredictable, and the mix of horror and shooter elements keeps things tense. It’s clear the developers are putting a lot of effort into making the world feel alive and dangerous. If you love immersive, story-driven shooters with a hardcore survival edge, this one is worth keeping an eye on.",positive
"It was very fun. I was lucky to have the game run well, had some fps drops and a few bugs here and there but nothing game breaking.",positive
"Why is the looting in this game so bad? Why can't I loot armour off of dead bodies but the AI's can? So I have to kill enemies and just wait and pray they loot their buddies armour, why can't you lazy guys just add in the ability to take off the armours ourselves? KCD2 can do it infact a lot of things in that game is better than this, such as the day and night cycle even in KCD2 you can sleep in camps but there is nothing like that in stalker 2. If I need to sleep well I gotta run back all the way to base and if I am far and an emission is on the way well... good luck to me I guess and lastly the day and night system is still way too fast. Since the games a horror game I understand why its quick but in dying light 2 and 1 they did it so much better I don't get why you guys can't do better after hyping this game up for years its embarrassing. Now to the good parts I will say I do enjoy the world other than that flame pit anomaly hate that thing, the actual combat is fun and I do enjoy the aspects of how you want to play but also at the same time AI is weird. Now I am adding another point as this game just gets worse the more I play, optimisation is still trash sometimes i lose frames when in safe zones or even outside of it at times although a little bit rare. Have an issue where I obrained the Armarid lining blueprint but the game says I still don't own it.... I wish I could see what blueprints I have oh wait there isn't an option to check? Yeah 6.5/10 honestly for me we need more fixes for this game to be less annoying. The glitches it has might not lock me out but it is still so very annoying to deal with and playing a game work £80 for deluxe I feel like the money is wasted. I will honestly go back to KCD2 as they released the game and I had 0 issues or glitches and just enjoyed that to its fullest, this game has that potential but updates need to come out faster this games been out for almost 4 months now and there still has annoying glitches that make the game more difficult to play. Having an issue where I didn't give Partner gun to an NPC in Zalissa and now I can't get rid of it or even stash the weapon, it still thinks its a quest item even though the quest completed now I have a permanent 4kg gone. NERF THE AMOUNT OF BULLETS MUTANTS EAT ALREADY!!! I am sick and tired of wasting so many bullets on one mutant the only thing that can kill them fast is a saiga until u meet a pseudogiant which can eat more than 100 rounds and god forbid you have to use an assault, smg or anything else that isn't a shotgun. Its stupid that I need to install mods to make your game more playable this is like cyberpunk all over again, the sad thing is this game has so much potential; even though its my first stalker game I don't hate it I just find these type of things annoying to deal with. The aim of a single player game is to sit back and relax, my last point is games like this need new game plus as some upgrades or items/weapons only spawn in the late game. So... I can't use the most broken items in the game until I finish the game or how about the fact the SVU has no silencer even though it is in the game files? No one as of yet has found a silencer for that gun but you can spawn it with console commands, IDK who thought that this game was released finished cause it seems like they be forgetting some things they added themselves. Enemies also shooting through walls and stealth being almost none existence as enemies still see you from almost anywhere on the map, just like the mission I am on where I need to rendevous with the ward squad. Countless enemies hiding in the building but I can't see where they are as I would think once they shoot I can see where they fired from, also the audio is still bugged AF from the beginning of the game till the end and it only seems to effect the mutants. If I walk away from the area I killed them and walk back or even load a save I always hear the crying screams of the Mutants and like most glitches in this game its so bloody annoying FIX ALL OF THIS ASAP STOP TALKING ABOUT HAVING 6 MILLION PLAYERS FOR A GAME THATS STILL BROKEN SMH. 

Ill be willing to change this whole review if we get some more better updates.",negative

"[h1]STALKER 2 Review: A Journey Through Disappointment[/h1]

I really, really wanted to like this game. I gave it every chance, ignored its flaws at first, and hoped it would get better with time. But it didn’t. In fact, it somehow got worse. So let’s break it down from the beginning.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Atmosphere: The One Thing It Got Right[/h2]
[b]The environments? Pretty solid.[/b] The Zone is immersive, eerie, and atmospheric, just as much as a post-apocalyptic wasteland can be. Walking through desolate ruins, hearing distant gunfire, and spotting anomalies in the distance? Yeah, that part works. But an immersive world means nothing if you don’t care about what happens in it—and that’s where the game starts to fall apart.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Story and World: Why Should I Care?[/h2]
The story starts off with a bit of intrigue, but it quickly loses steam. I found myself not caring about any of the people I met. There’s no real emotional connection, no reason to invest in their struggles. That would still be fine if the world itself were interesting. But [b]it’s not.[/b] The sense of discovery is completely missing.

Instead of organically exploring, I just followed quest markers, hoping to stumble upon something cool. But every time I arrived at a new point of interest, I found... some ammo. Maybe a bottle of vodka. A few random supplies. No interesting NPCs, no compelling side quests, just a static, lifeless world.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Loot and Rewards: Why Even Bother?[/h2]
I’m fine with the lack of character progression, but at least make exploration rewarding! Instead, 90% of the loot spots contain useless junk. Food, vodka, a handful of bullets. Occasionally, I’d find a gun or armor, but nothing that made me feel like I was uncovering something valuable or meaningful. Even anomaly hunting, which should be one of the coolest aspects of the game, became a chore after getting the anomaly detector. Follow the beeping, grab the anomaly, realize it’s just a minor stat boost, and move on. Thrilling.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Mutants: A Bullet Sponge Nightmare[/h2]
Mutants should be one of the highlights of the game—this is the freakin’ Exclusion Zone! But they’re just a nuisance. They don’t drop loot, they don’t provide anything interesting, and they’re not even fun to fight. They just soak up bullets. And the worst part? [b]They’re dumb.[/b] The sixth bloodsucker that charges at me in a 30-minute session isn’t scary or exciting. And if I hop onto a barrel? It’s game over for them. They just run in circles, confused, while I casually blast them with a shotgun. It’s laughable.

Human enemies aren’t much better. Their only real skill is throwing grenades with sniper-like accuracy. Other than that, they’re as dumb as the mutants. And don’t even get me started on friendly NPCs—they might as well be mannequins.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Stamina and Traversal: The True Horror of the Zone[/h2]
The Zone could be a fascinating place to explore, but moving through it is a nightmare. Even when not over-encumbered, my character runs like an 80-year-old grandpa. Ten meters in, I’m out of stamina. Time for an energy drink! Oh, wait—energy drinks only last for 15 seconds. Now I’m out of stamina again. Drink another one. But now I’m hungry, so I have to eat some bread. And now I’m thirsty. It’s a never-ending cycle of frustration.

[b]A better system?[/b] Let me craft a stamina-boosting potion or meal that lasts for half a day instead of chugging canned energy drinks like a desperate college student during finals week. It would be more immersive and far less annoying.

How much better would it have been if I actually had to go on a quest to gather the materials for these energy-boosting items? Imagine having to scavenge the Zone for rare herbs, mutant glands, or other exotic resources instead of just picking up a can from the ground. Then, finding an NPC who has the proper tools and skills to brew or craft these items. Maybe they could even offer a side quest where you have to earn their trust before they help you. That would make the entire system feel meaningful instead of just an endless cycle of drinking store-bought energy drinks.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Graphics and Performance: A Bleeding Mess[/h2]
At first glance, the graphics seem fine. But the longer you play, the more issues you notice. The lighting system is completely broken. I walk into a shack with multiple windows at noon, and it’s pitch black inside. The game’s global illumination system just doesn’t work right.

And performance? [b]Yikes.[/b] My rig isn’t a potato (5800X, 32GB RAM, 4070 Super), but I can only get decent framerates with DLSS Performance mode and frame generation on. Even then, the game feels sluggish, and frame drops to the 40s and 50s are frequent. Everything looks smeary and noisy, and it’s just not pleasant to play. I honestly think the game would have been better if it wasn’t fully open-world. Breaking it into 3-4 large zones with loading screens could have made it way more optimized and stable.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]NPCs and AI: Welcome to 2010 (or 2023 Bethesda)[/h2]
NPCs move and act like they belong in a 2010 Bethesda game. Actually, scratch that—maybe a 2023 Bethesda game ([i]looking at you, Starfield[/i]). They get stuck on the smallest obstacles, they look lifeless, and their animations are stiff and unnatural. Facial animations? Barely there. The so-called A-Life system? It’s a joke. The original STALKER’s AI was better than this 20 years ago. Let that sink in.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Final Thoughts: The Sad Reality[/h2]
I wanted to love this game. I really did. I loved the original STALKER, and I hoped this would be a worthy successor. But every time I think about booting it up, I hesitate—and then I just don’t. And that’s the biggest sign that something is wrong.

I hope they fix the technical issues, but even then, the core gameplay itself has fundamental problems that won’t be easy to fix—if they can be fixed at all. Right now, STALKER 2 isn’t just a disappointment. [b]It’s a missed opportunity.[/b]",negative
"So you watch an Intro, you play for 5 minuts in a scripted tutorial, then you meet a group of 4-5 people that will shoot you as soon as you go out in the open. You cant turn off the flashlight and sneak around, they just shoot you as soon as you go out in the open for the first time. 
So after 10 deaths on medium in 5 minuts, I had to ragequit, and wow what a bad game. Did I mention that each of the enemy needs around 20 shots and they will kill you with 2. Cant recommend as it was like the worst experience ever! 

I know 5 euro games that gives more entertaiment-value then this unbalanced piece of release!",negative
"Excessive camera movement and head bobbing that leads to nausea and motion sickness, no option to turn off.",negative
"This game breaks my heart. I went through a full playthrough before 1.2 hit, and I loved it. It was broken at points, yes, but it enthralled me with it's strong story and solid gameplay - firefights were relatively intense and varied, and I quickly grew attached to the weapons I used. Since the 1.2 patch, I have not been able to play. The framerate is terrible and the keyboard input is even worse. There is significant input lag on my keyboard, where I can press ""W"" for one second but the game continues to move me forward for ten seconds. This game is awesome, the developers very clearly put their hearts and souls into this, but it is literally unplayable in its current state. I will come back and try a second play through when things are fixed. Slava Ukraini",positive
"Takes you back to Old School FPS feel. This doesn't cheapen the experience, but makes for a an extremely enjoyable game. Stalker 2 is not without it's faults but overall has been solid game and I would definitely recommend.",positive
Get out of here STALKER,positive
"I am going to leave a positive Review because I have faith the Devs will fix the issues this game currently has.

For Context a little bit about my system:

13th Gen i7
Nvidia RTX 4070
128gb DDR5

The Bad:
This game currently has some kind of massive memory leak. Because after about 2 hours it will spike my memory to 99% and freeze. BUT to be clear this is the only problem I personally experience.

The Good:
This game is absolutely gorgeous, amazing, tons of depth and enormous regions to explore!
Its everything you could ever want in a Stalker game. And the attention to detail is absolutely insane! Real world locations line up with a level of accuracy that, is just completely unmatched.

I highly recommend going back and playing the other games. (In any order just play them too!)
BUT if this is your first STALKER Experience and if you are patient with the development team, you will not be disappointed!",positive
"very great sequel to an amazing trilogy, I have waited 10+ years to play it and they did not let me down at all on this reboot unlike other publishers nowadays.",positive
Its a lot better now compared to when it released and it has very few bugs now,positive

"Optimisation is pretty terrible, worst I've seen in a game for a while. Seems to have consistent memory leaking issues, other than that it seems good so far, but these issues make it near impossible for me to play for now.",negative

"bad me no like like, mid",negative

"I am very disappointed in one thing about this game which occurred after the recent update. After the recent mega update which occurred in February of 2025, I have lost all of my armor and artifacts. I did not have enough money to buy anything sufficient to keep going so after 25 hours and $60.00 later, I had to uninstall it, without knowing how it ends.",negative
"Padded, overly restrictive burdening system, bad economy, simple systems that were intriguing 15 years ago and just not enough today.

A bargain bin game being sold for 90$ CAD.",negative
"The characters of the game look convincing, with well-written characters, their dialogues and relationships between them provide additional emotional depth. All characters have their own goals and motives, which are ready to build not only the plot, but also the atmosphere of the Zone. The role of choice is palpable. the player faces dilemmas that can significantly affect the course of the game. Each decision has consequences, after which you can choose different approaches to resolving the situation.",positive
4308,positive
"10/10, I love getting shot in the foot and dying instantly.",positive
"Its fun but it runs like poo without framegen on , which meant I needed to download a mod to reduce the awful input lag (on a 4070ti Super )

And the mutants just arent fun to fight, which meant I need to download a mod to reduce their health significantly 

So If you are they type to not want to go into modding the game (its very easy though) then I would say dont bother 

Game is also just confusing story wise, you just going on wild goose chase for people you dont know for unkown reasons all the time 

I think Metro Exodus is much better tbh",positive
my computer struggles to run this game,negative
"The game feels very unfinished, despite requiring nearly 100GB of updates almost daily during the first month after release. There are numerous game-breaking bugs, making it nearly unplayable. At times, I even had to use console commands to progress through main quests that wouldn't advance naturally. However, the world design and graphics are impressive, and to some extent, the gunplay and combat are enjoyable. I hope that with a few years of updates and support, the game can eventually reach its full potential, but in its current state, I can't recommend it.",negative
spamming quick save like in the good old times,positive
I'm a big fan of the stalker series and this game does not let it down A+++,positive
"I was really excited to play this game, and naturally bought it on launch day. Unfortunately owning 5700X and an RTX 2080 means GSC thinks I am too poor to play their game. What seems like it could be a good game is ruined by absolutely god awful optimization. This is a problem that plagues just about every new game that is released these days, and we need to start speaking out against it. 

Developers, take the time to optimize your games. 

Gamers, refund games from developers who don't, and start speaking up.",negative
I enjoy. The bugs are funny,positive
"Good:
- Nostalgia for the first Stalker
- Open world (almost fully copypasted from the first game)
- A lot of weapons
- Beautiful picture (only for daylight)

Bad:
- A lot of bugs and crashes even in Mar 25.
- Deluxe and Ultimate editions are useless (from weapons and armor point of view - they not needed as you find better analogues before open these stashes). As for Season pass - let's see.
- Wired and difficult to understand plot, weak dialogs, strange plot moves (most often I didn't liked all choices and all NPCs).
- Small amount of side quests.
- Balance is for those who like pain and don't like get pleasure from playing game. 
- Almost always night and a lot of basement scenes.

Summary: buy this game only on discount and play only with mods.",negative
++,positive
BEST GAME 2024,positive
"i love my $60 slide show, in fact i love it so much i haft to post a negative review to gate keep others from enjoying this. sadly the game runs fine for the first 15-30 minutes when i start it. afterwards at randomly the real show begins. 2 frames a second beauty.",negative
Horrible optimization. No one wants to have to use frame generation it makes the game feel terrible and look terrible.,negative
"Well, I really want to like the game. I got that game gifted otherwise I wouldn't have played it yet. But seriously, I do not think I will continue. The longer I play the worse the game gets. Despite everything that has been written already, the basic game is decent. But there are still so many bugs, I woundn't even consider them features. For instance, stealth is a hoax. Enemies spot you afar before you even notice them. You can run but you cannot hide. No, wait! You cannot run, at least not outrun them really beacause of the heavy loot you carry. And you will need anything you can get to sell and have coupons (currency) for repairs and upgrades and stuff. Don't get me started playing the game without mods. But here's the kicker: after the last updates (1.2) the game freezes and crashes several times. It is literally unplayable for me right now... In addition the frames drop further down. How ist that possible? I had fun for a couple of hours but now it is just annoying. It's quite a walking simulator, too. The furher the story goes, the more distant your ways are. Great! There is no taxi, yet you could use a guide from time to time (i.e. fast travel in exchange for some coupons).
I'll give it a try after the next update, maybe.",negative
"Do not buy this game. It is not ready to be played thoroughly and is clearly rushed project. The concept itself is a lot of fun to play with, but the game realized is not. Effectively being sniped by shotguns, mutants the size of a dog may as well be bullet proof, and that's just scratching the surface.",negative
10/10!,positive
"Unfortunately the sentiment of ""this game is going to be good one day"" is all too true.

It's missing so many trivial, basic mechanics that its predecessors already had. The beauty of the zone is wasted because it feels empty. When encounters do pop up, they feel scripted and unnatural.

The game is clearly half-baked or was stripped of a variety of things to give off the guise of it being optimized. It was obviously rushed to release.

I wont sugarcoat it, it definitely needed another year in the oven. It's probably better to get on sale unless you want to support the devs because of the hell-hoops they've had to jump through.",negative
"One of the worst games I have played in a long time, what an excuse of a game to be associated with any other Stalker title.",negative

"[h1] S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2 - A strong modernisation of a beloved franchise [/h1]

Firstly its important to recognise the hard work of GSC Game World and their commitment to this game through recently trying times, especially the war in Ukraine. I wish the team all the best and thank you for your work. 

I'm a huge fan of the S.T.AL.K.E.R franchise and think this game needs a more thorough breakdown to highlight why its worth getting and what its like.

Stalker 2 at its heart is a modernisation of the franchise which stays true to its origins but also implements various new features to help keep the game up to date and appealing to modern audiences without detracting too much from what made it a cult classic in the first place.

[h2] The Game was buggy at launch, is it still? [/h2]
This was a major flag on release but GSC has done an amazing job at rolling out updates & patches to help fix issues players faced on launch. The game is in a stable place and plays well. Stalker at its heart was considered 'eurojank' back in the early 2000's as the trilogy also saw technical issues of their own. Its always been that way and GSC have come a long way since then. We've seen frequent patches to address major issues which is great to see.

[h2] The game isnt like the originals (isnt it?) [/h2]
Stalker 2 is not like a game from 2007. It's a game from 2024. What people often forget is there is a 15 year gap in the development of the original 3 stalker games and stalker 2.

Stalker 2 plays like the previous stalker games which is honestly astonishing and a testament to their commitment to keeping the game feeling like a Stalker game. The gameplay loop is what you'd expect, the world is thorough and detailed and most of all the zone feels more alive than ever.

[h3] What changed over 15 years then? [/h3]
Stalker 2 is slightly less forgiving than previous installments in the series, it is however still an extremely challenging game in terms of mechanics with enemies still being just as dangerous as you'd remember. Where the game has changed is in its story telling & difficulty. The game now features waypoints & map markers and more streamlined narrative, something that wasnt as apparent in previous entries in the series. 

This is a change that might irk some die hard fans of the original games but for a 2024 audience the team has implemented these QOL changes well to help draw in newer players. These waypoints are done well using the in-game PDA so it doesnt break immersion and fits the narrative.

Lastly the story - it's more high budget and grand than previous entries but also quite exciting to see what it means for the future of the franchise.

[h2] Should I get it? [/h2]

If you're looking for a challenging fps game that has you managing resources and scavenging the game world with light immersive sim elements you'll thoroughly enjoy Stalker 2.

If you're a Stalker Fan - you'll also thoroughly enjoy stalker 2.

This is a AAA level game in a series thats been asleep for over 15 years and its great to see it brought back to the limelight in a modern way thats drawn in so many new people.

Thank you GSC Game World.

"this is probably my game of the year. yes it has bugs and other flaws, but if you can get past those hiccups it's truly one of the best open world games i've played in a while. if you loved the fallout games you'll probably love this one too",positive
"I don't know why people are downvoting this game. This came out during wartime. This game was made by people with a passion who produced a coherent game that was genuinely a joy to experience. We shouldn't have gotten this game. By all accounts, this should have been something that got shelved until the war stopped, but we still got a playable, enjoyable, nearly bug free experience. This is a stalker game, and I will love it forever. Get yourself a copy, sit by the fire, stalker, and enjoy some sausage and vodka.",positive

"BUYER BEWARE

Recommended because the game is too good. Yet is crashes all the time even on the most powerful computer, and it has serious bugs such as weapons disappearing or artifacts not spawning, which is fucked up, very annoying and unacceptable. Game has already been patched multiple times!

",positive
"The story is engaging and truly enjoyable. I had a great time experiencing it.

The graphics are absolutely stunning—no complaints there.

The gameplay is satisfying, and you can spend hours freely exploring the map, enjoying both the mechanics and the incredible environmental design.

However, the optimization is rough. Even with a high-end NVIDIA GPU, running the game at 1080p on Epic settings without Frame Generation or DLSS, it’s hard to maintain a stable 60 FPS.

There are still some bugs here and there, even after multiple updates, and some of them can negatively impact the experience.

A few things feel missing for a game in this genre. Personally, I really noticed the lack of more detailed gore and dismemberment, which would have added to the immersion.

The weapon upgrade system is decent, but it could have been better. The variety of firearms is good, but the absence of melee weapons is definitely noticeable.

Overall, I’d still highly recommend this game.",positive
"i LOVE stalker games, ever since SOC and have played them all multiple times. I want to like this game so much, but it's so buggy that it's unplayable in many parts. I can't believe I paid full price for a broken game. 

Wait for a sale, or more patches, or both.",negative
Game is one of the most immersive games I've ever played.,positive
"Sounds like a game to shelf for a while.

It always feels like something is missing. This is especially when you've finished a side mission, realise you have a long walk ahead of you to the next marker, and there's just nothing. 

This is my first Stalker game. Intrigued by what others have said about the series.",negative
"if i would pay $15 for it, it would be fine, but $60 too much, the textures are not there, overall this game feels cheap.",negative
Game main mission is bugged after the point of no return. You will not be able to finish the game.,negative
"Had high hopes for this release, but the final straw was the latest patch which rendered it unplayable. A shameful missed opportunity...",negative
Pretty much unplayable in its current state. This game will run like shit while looking like an early ps4 title. You can *techincally* hit decent fps with ai generated frames but those will still have the latency of a poor framerate. this is unacceptable in a fast paced fps where you frequently die in one or two shots.,negative
"PLEASE FIX THE FLASHLIGHT PLEASE PLEASE

edit came back for a serious review. Stalker 2 is okay, as someone whos spent a lot of time with the OG stalker games and their derivative modpacks this game definitely scratched a special itch for me but while im still enjoying the game 60 hours in the itch is starting to not itch so good,one of the main reasons is lack of simple grunt work, i shouldnt have to wait 3 in game days to refresh a quest once im done with one or make it so you can take more than one at a time, there should be more of a reason to go on expeditions than looking through your 100th stash of doing main quests.",positive

This was my favourite game for a while... until i ran into literally game breaking bugs. Can't even continue my save files because of the bugs.,negative
"Huge fan of the originals but ultimately disappointed with this sequel. The game still needs a lot of work. They nailed the atmosphere mostly, but A-Life still needs work. Unreal 5 is not the right engine for this game. Most games to be fair. At times it can look great but others god awful.

The first 2/3 are quite enjoyable gameplay/story wise (bugs aside) but the last 1/3 is an absolute slog to play and is clearly not finished. The story also becomes kinda boring by the end tbh. Bullet spongey enemies literally spawn on top of you. Many other issues and cracks are very apparent in the last part of the game sadly so I can't recommend it ultimately. Really brings it down. Maybe if GSC really gets it together and finishes this game eventually I may replay with mods and update the review but for now I would just play originals or Anomaly/Gamma instead.",negative
" Hello! As a hard-bitten, veteran Stalker fan who is at this very moment also playing through my GOG version of Shadow of Chernobyl with the ""Complete"" mod I heartily recommend you purchase this phenomenal product!

 The team did the impossible: They created the absolute, most fantastic rusted-out, dystopic playground with tons and tons of detail and environmental storytelling we all love and sorely miss! Little things like happening across a door with a 2x4 keeping it closed, but the first time you were on the other side of it!  

The story is solid if a bit meandering, english voice-acting is partchy; The Colonel is a the a great character but English-Skif sounds like a moody teenager while Ukrainian Skif sounds like somebody who's tired of this shit and 'show me who I have to shoot' to be done-with-it. There is plenty of the that!

 Story was never the important thing but it will take you on a lovely tour of The Zone and all of its surviving characters!  The first character you see in the original SHoC intro, Red; the guy that delivered Strelok to Sidorovich.  He has a quest or at least you can meet him. I missed that my first time around, only having it mentioned as a possibility and later scrubbed because I already met somebody else, but it's just another thing to throw on the enormous pile or replayability!

With the most recent major patch the issues with laser accuracy/aim-botting opponents have largely been fixed. Then, having a few quality-of-life mods like being able to grab a ledge at head-height are not necessary but, after 250+ hours, they've become a near-necessity and opened up a lot more tactical possibilities! And there's so much to explore!

The UE5 engine and the weird fractal-lighting/DLSS/AMD-FSR bits are a small price to pay for such a solid and enduring playground of the imagination! If you don't have near-tier PC you'll probably get some chugging. The Rostok memory choking issue has been fixed and the next thing is to eliminate enemies spawning near you; and the bloodsucker roar.

The people that built this rusted, creaking playground (I need a Tetanus shot just looking at it!) have succeeded beyond the most fevered dreams of this cold-hearted cynic that thought ""there's no way they can do justice to the Zone, it'll be some guided-tour/partitioned experience."" There are, to this very moment huge areas I have still not explored, namely the Burnt Forest. I'm currently finishing up my second vanilla playthrough (Ward) and eagerly looking forward to starting my third!

 To wrap it all up, the most important thing is that The Zone, the main character, is well-represented and in spades! 

 From start to finish this is pure S.T.A.L.K.E.R., for all the good and all the bad, through and through!",positive
"şubat ortasında çıkan patchden sonra oyun deli gibi optimizasyon yedi. saçma sapan droplar vs kalktı ortadan. artık yüksek veya epic ayarlarda çok rahat oynayabiliyorum rtx 3070 ekran kartı ile. yıllardır beklediğim oyundu, benim için bu oyunun çıkış tarihi son patchden sonrası resmen. keşif yapmak ve çatışmalara girmek gerçekten çok eğlenceli. yıllardır beklediğime deydi resmen.",positive
"Yes, very very much.",positive
"I swear to god this is the LAST TIME I buy anything developed under UE5.
This engine is an absolute heap of unoptimizable garbage that ruins the experience every single time.
If you dont have an RTX, don't even try running this game, minimum requirements are an absolute joke at this point. Epic Games is the devil.
Its even more jarring considering how every Stalker game before this one is able to run on a potato whilst incorporating much more interesting and complex systems.
No A life, bugs everywhere, horrible performances just for a minimal if even perceptible improvement to visual quality..
This is such a betrayal of the original license, and for what ?!",negative
"One time an npc blocked a door but i slept and he moved,and some other time they would see me when i turned the flashlight on while in a vent, passed the game on veteran and 2 bugs only. Amazing game like the ones before it. weird enough, theres no stutter if its played offline.",positive
"It pains my heart to give this a dislike, especially after dumping 60 hours into STALKER difficulty. Alas, do not buy this game now. Give it time. It is not finished, by any means necessary, not even close. No mods can save this mess of a code, no DLSS, no frame generation, the moment you walk into an area like Rostok all goes to hell. Setting the game to high, epic or low does not change anything, using DLSS Swapper and some mod tweaks help but it was impossible for my 3070 Ti & 5600X to go over 80FPS at BEST where nothing but grass exists with DLSS on Performance, and at the end of the game i've crashed at least 10 times in a row, while not being able to achieve more than 35 fps. This is early access at best. While i understand developing a game under a war is very hard, no product should be shipped in this condition. I detest anyone giving this game a thumbs up while this game is not playable on 70% of the setups of everyone who bought the game. I played Cyberpunk 2077, which in my opinion is much more characteristic than this game, when it first launched with all those bugs, and i was not getting less than 80FPS. This game does not have the visuals, the AI, the atmosphere to neither match previous games' nor be this hard on your system. 

Lack of optimization aside, the AI is garbage, even with the ""Enemies miss sometimes"" update you get 360 noscope'd and get sweared on your mamma and entire family. Random enemy spawns. Impossible stealth with unrealistically aware enemies where if a wind moves one strand of your ass hair you immediately get ganged up on. I even had one event where i stealth killed someone, only for that dude to respawn immediately and alert everyone on my ass. It's funny how game says ""Zone likes it quiet"" while the devs absolutely shat their pants on how to make stealth mechanics. First FEAR games had AI that was a million times better than this. 

Guns break off too easy. If soldiers used weapons from this game, wars would be won by those who used swords. 

A-Life is non-existent. Allies t-posing in buildings, emissions breaking the game, mutants bugging off, with this state San Andreas was more lively than whatever this game is offering. 

Little to none customization in the game. You can't even get a damn flashlight as the devs pulled of the ""Its in your pipboy"" trick. 

Everything aside, story is mid at best too. Skif is a pointless war machine, Strelok doesn't feel like Strelok, Scar is the only character with a soul and the dude's a chaotic evil with bipolar personality disorder, schizophrenia and a product of an unloving family, and the rest of the characters are not even worth remembering. Also whose idea was it to give Richter a visible casette player and very visible headphones but no option to give the character to play music on the go? Is Skif dumb? Is he not aware of the walkman mixtapes or discmans? No MP3 exist in this universe but Gauss Gun can exist? 

Everything aside, the game was fun for the first 40 hours or so. Then it gets complicated graphics, chugs of bigger than it can eat and digest, gets full of bugs, performance problems, lack of side quests, goddamn question mark ""Stalker cache here bby"" filler points and anomalies that are just not worth picking up. 

I enjoyed playing this game but after a while i only pushed to finish the game and give the Zone its deserved end, even though i like none of the endings and don't like the point game's trying to make with the agent thing. No spoilers, you'll understand when you get to the ending. Or just skip it and watch the lore videos as the game is probably unplayable for most. 

I hope one day this game gets to its prime position and is not abandoned, where i can go back and try to get all the endings.",negative

"S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 is a great game that is unfortunately spoil mostly by Unreal engine 5.

The game respect the previous entry while offering a huge play zone to scavenge.
I found the story good and intriguing.

A part from the terrible performance that offer UE5, there is a few things can be fixed like A-Life and gun balance.
While half of the game seems balanced, after that you just encounter exoskeleton that will make them feel like bullet sponge due to the poor gun balance.

Nonetheless, this game as such a high immersion, high quality environment, that feel unique and good.

75 hours to finish the game seems really fair.

Like I said at the beginning, it's a good game that is mostly spoil by UE 5",positive

"Most satisfied I've been with a game in ages. Atmosphere is amazing, gameplay is great, exploration is rewarding. Only thing that lets it down a little is the terrible optimisation. Yet the many crashes and constant fps issues haven't stopped me from enjoying the heck out of it.",positive
Still has a lot of bugs but most of them add to the charm. Great game with a good story. I enjoyed it.,positive
"Game is very frustrating, no logical flow and you spend a lot of time running around in circles not knowing what you are supposed to do next, than suddenly a door opens and you can stumble along a little further. But the total most stupid thing is trying to catch dam artifacts  Just wave your arms in the air, click the f button as fast as you can, throw some bolts around and than maybe you will fluke catching one of these stupid things. Not even close to the Metro Exodus games. Only way to progress in this game is to have utube open on another computer and search for a guide to reach the next mission unless you want to stumble around and smash all your computer screens in frustration.
",negative
"I had a blast with this game, and it felt to me like it was a true modern follow-up to S.T.A.L.K.E.R., in both good and bad ways. Maintaining the original inventory and crafting systems was good, the gunplay is snappy and guns feel unique. The world is beautiful and truly feels massive. However, this is truly S.T.A.L.K.E.R.. The economy balanced with the carry weights? Punishing. Mutant health and design? Punishing and questionable at best, incredibly unfair and worth running from at worst. The size of the world is probably too big, with few settlements and a high likelihood that you will be carrying around loot over encumbered for a large portion of the game's duration, possibly up to 10%, depending on how much of a loot goblin you are. The final mission is also horrifically punishing in a way that is unlike anything else in the game. The story has a lot of technobabbel, and can be hard to follow, but there are lots of treats and references in store for fans of the original trilogy. Overall, I feel that it succeeds in being not only a S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game, but in being an easy first introduction for most people into the Zone, even if the Zone takes them instead of player coming to love the Zone.",positive
UNPLYABLE,negative
"S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2 is the ambitious game I thought it was going to be, 15+ years of Mounting Expectations requires a Massive project. The Developers needed to overhaul everything:


Did they Succeed? Short answer: Yes. Buy it and have fun.

Long Answer: Its more Nuanced... First, Allow me to tell you what I did as soon as Started the game and what I recommend you do as well.

Step one: Turn off the compass and Floating Markers. This will immediately Make moment to moment game-play better and less handholdy as YOU the player will have to pay attention and look around the environment more closely. 99% of the game can be played like this with nothing but upsides the only exception is a few segments where it seems the level designers used the compass and markers as a crutch to guide players through a convoluted environment.
 
With that out of the way. I'll give you the good and the bad. 

The Good: 

+The Gunplay is fun Updated and very Competent, Some old tactics from the Trilogy Work better than ever and some don't in the slightest. 
+The Zone is Perfect. Things are moved around and that can be confusing at first but once you adapt you can make your way just about anywhere in the zone without a map using only intuition and the adventurers spirit
+There are secrets everywhere and the exploration is rewarding and fun. Sometimes the game is obvious about it and sometimes you must be clever to figure things out
+The Key Characters are Well Written and feel like actual people with goals and ideals (Even Scar). the Side Characters are very much effective at their job of making the Zone feel alive, even the dead parts.
+The Missions are Fun and there are more than enough thought provoking moments in the story to make you wonder
+Side Jobs are a good time killer if you have nothing to do and need a *Small* bit of money.
+Environment and environmental storytelling is masterclass, Every place feels Lived in, like countless stalkers came before you and did something wherever you are, the places sealed until you unseal them feel like they were absolutly bustling with energy at one time, as if the great work was carrying on till the last moment when the Zone was created.
+The absolute attention to detail. there are so many Little things that pile up and make a big difference, you may not consciously notice but your brain will and it will color your experience.
+Sound design is crisp and you can often hear treats before they appear in your face, and the benefit of it is: the game never tells you ""This is what a bloodsucker sounds like from 20 feet away"" you have to learn this and keep it in mind as you go from being a rookie to being a Legend.
+Art Direction goes above and beyond and is a highlight.
+The Endings give you a lot to think about and seem like fitting conclusions with only 1 exception and for those players... I feel bad for you.
+Skif is a compelling protagonist, Hes enough of a blank slate to project yourself onto but also his own character enough to the point you pick dialog options just to hear him talk about something. The closest i can compare him to is Vincent From Cyberpunk 2077.
+Almost all of the Bugs in the game are more on the Funny Glitch side of the isle than the game breaking. I do suggest making Hardsaves Before every story Mission just to be safe.
+Knowledge of the previous games is an added Benefit not a requirement, but the significance of some scenes are hurt by not knowing the backstory for some characters involved, and there are stashes that come back from the trilogy
+Voice acting for most characters is good

The Bad

-There isn't really a good ""Step off Point"" in the game where you can forget the main story and just explore the zone. Instead what really will happen is you will *want* to start the next story mission but you need upgrades or repairs so you will get sidetracked by that before you resume the main story, which Clicked for me personally but there are many players who will want a guilt free reason to ignore the plot.
-Everything is animations based Especially Skif, so if you hit a hotkey to heal and the game fails to start the animation, Skif will stand there and continue to be Shot, Stabbed, Mauled, Anomalied until the game goes ""OH"" and allows you to heal. or more likely you will die. This happens the most directly after loading a save so take 20 seconds for the game to catch up. 
-Reloading the game is a problem that takes a while and even then the game has to Cycle Through the LOD until it renders everything. I have a Upper Midline PC well above the recommended specs and no matter what settings I tweak this always happens. and if you go into a new area faster than the game can load it you can get massive levels of pop in.
-There are not enough Guides in the game and how they work is inferior to the previous games. they wont take you to new places only places you've been and price is determined by Distance and Reputation with their faction.
-For 99% of the game If you want to Upgrade your weapons there realistically is only one choice, because there is only 1 tech that can and upgrade everything you find and bring back to base. To keep it Spoiler free, The Further north the Technician is the better services they provide. 
-Duty and Freedom are changed completely from their depiction in the trilogy. and The Ward is Just Duty with White and Green instead of Black and Red
-There is no Bandit Radio
-There is no Duty Radio
-Travel times can be a bit long especially when you're slightly overweight
-Physical protection artifacts do not work against Bullets or claws like the loading screens say, only anomalies. 
-The economy in this game is Busted. you will never have enough money to keep up with your gear and upgrades. Prices are too high while payouts for anything but Main quests are too low. which can be an added challenge that I appreciated early on. but it gets tedious fast. so the options are either get used to farming enemies for loot worth just ever so slightly more than the materials cost to acquire it. or Find a mod that tweaks the in game economy to offer you 30-40% of the value of the one of a kind Artifact you spent 10 hours working to find.
-The game too easy unless you are on the hardest difficulty, everything else feels to easy, but there are a few super tanky enemies that are annoying but manageable.
-Yellow Paint rears its ugly head so you will have to put up with that throughout the game. which is weird because there are actually some good environmental guidance methods other than Yellow Paint used.
-In the English version of the game the Voice acting is very good but the Accents are all over the place. There are very Few Ukrainian or even Russian accents in the game and most of it will be ""European"" accents but from where can be range from Vague to 1 British guy voicing 18 different men.
-some OG weapons simply do not make an appearance for no reason and some do make an appearance but as props. this also effects the balance a bit from previous games.
-Some weapons need several upgrades to be viable and some are so rare and useless they are more of a salt and pepper weapon than a viable choice for anything but easy baby mode. but this isn't communicated effectively to the player

All in all its Flaws are but minor in comparison to the Positives. Its an amazing game and i recommend you sink several hundred hours into it. most of the negatives can be Patched out and may already be patched out by the time you are reading this. 

Good Hunting Stalker

*Bandit radio starts blasting*",positive
"S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl, developed by GSC Game World, marks a significant return to the series' roots, offering an immersive and challenging experience that both honors and expands upon its predecessors. Set in a meticulously recreated post-apocalyptic Chernobyl, the game delivers a rich tapestry of atmospheric storytelling, dynamic gameplay, and technical innovation.

Atmosphere and World-Building

The game's setting is a testament to GSC Game World's dedication to detail. Utilizing Unreal Engine 5, the developers have crafted a visually stunning environment that captures the desolation and beauty of the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. The expansive open world, spanning approximately 60 square kilometers, is teeming with derelict structures, overgrown vegetation, and remnants of a once-thriving civilization. This setting not only serves as a backdrop but also as a character in its own right, influencing gameplay and narrative.

Gameplay and Mechanics

S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 offers a unique blend of first-person shooting, survival horror, and immersive simulation. The combat system is robust, featuring a diverse array of weapons and equipment that cater to various playstyles. The introduction of the A-Life 2.0 system enhances the game's dynamic nature, with NPCs and mutants exhibiting more realistic behaviors and interactions. This system contributes to a living, breathing world where player choices and actions have tangible consequences.

Narrative and Storytelling

The narrative follows Skif, a character drawn into the irradiated zone after a catastrophic explosion. The storyline is rich and multifaceted, offering players a deep and engaging experience. The game's plot is intricately woven, with multiple branching paths and endings that encourage replayability. The developers have skillfully integrated elements of Ukrainian culture and history, adding depth and authenticity to the narrative.

Technical Aspects and Performance

Upon release, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 faced technical challenges, including performance issues and bugs. However, GSC Game World has demonstrated a strong commitment to addressing these concerns. Subsequent patches have significantly improved the game's stability and performance, enhancing the overall experience. The developers' responsiveness to community feedback underscores their dedication to delivering a polished product.

Critical Reception

Critics have lauded S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 for its atmospheric depth and innovative gameplay. The game has been praised for its unique blend of genres and its ability to immerse players in a hauntingly beautiful yet perilous world. While some reviews have noted technical issues, the consensus is that the game's strengths far outweigh its shortcomings. For instance, PC Gamer described it as ""the best hardcore survival shooter I've played, and few settings can live up to The Zone's beauty or bleakness."" 
GAMESRADAR

Conclusion

S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl stands as a remarkable achievement in the gaming industry. Its dedication to atmospheric storytelling, innovative gameplay mechanics, and technical excellence makes it a standout title. For both newcomers and long-time fans of the series, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 offers a compelling and immersive experience that is not to be missed.",positive

"Down to its core this game is undeniably a Stalker sequel and GSC managed to combine the stories from all 3 previous titles into this culminated effort in a somewhat surprisingly decent way. The Stalker games never did have the most straightforward lore to begin with but if you're looking for a game that has good gunplay and plenty of lore this could be the game for you. The downsides to this game are understandably big reasons why some people wouldn't recommend the game i.e. performance, optimization, gun balancing, bugs, etc. If you're able to actually run the game with decent FPS and are looking for a challenge I would definitely recommend the game, but I would definitely wait for it to go on sale first though. Also without any spoilers, the ending segment of the game is substantially worse than the first 90% of the game so just a heads-up.",positive
its tight man,positive
"Had to wait for some patches because I had graphics issues with the release version. I'm happy to report those issues have been fixed and the game works flawlessly for me now.

Overall, it's a 7/10, it's a good game, it's a decent Stalker, BUT it doesn't quite manage to capture the atmosphere of the old Stalker games, because:

- There are way too many resources, like Medkits, Ammo etc. Even on hardest difficult the game is trivial because of this and it takes away a lot of the Survival aspect that the old games had.
- Enemies sometimes burst you down with a 6 shot salvo from 700m away in absolute darkness through 20m of foliage. And it's not a case of ""They shot a salvo in your direction and a few hit."" It's ""They hit 6/6 shots.""
- Those small mutant dogs are a bit too tanky, I think. They are tiny and scrawny and literally facetank 2 Headshots from my AKM and continue running at and biting me.
- The Voiceacting is really not the yellow from the egg.
- Bloodsuckers are being used way too much which makes them lose their mysticism and scaryness factor. I knew it was a bad sign that a Bloodsucker spawns in the Tutorial.

But all that being said, I do enjoy the game so far.

For people who have never played the old Stalker games but were hesitant because of the old graphics and difficult gameplay, this is an excellent opportunity to get into the Zone.
For old Stalker fans: Difficult to say whether you'll like it or not. I think it comes down to personal preference.",positive
"Amazing game, just needs some big changes after the big patches, For starters FSR3 works but at the cost of screen tearing, (I have 144hz Benq ex3210U) monitor and no matter what settings I change it won't fix the issue, I have gone as far as using Nvidia Profile inspector and DLSS swapper and nothing seems to fix the screen tearing, outside of that game needs some sort of fast travel system back to various bases instead of slow walking all the way back to a camp and paying to fast travel seems a bit harsh. I know this game has mods but the base game feels like a walking sim after exploring 70 percent of the map.",positive

I expected a realistic and immersive shooter. Sadly the gun modding is very boring and most of the time doesnt even show the changes on the model. Combat is also very arcady with enemies being very dumb and bullet sponges. Was very excited to play the game and even got a new PC for it. Cant recommend,negative
"love it. very few bugs so far. love the sneaking, the FPS, the puzzles, mystery. reminds me of dayz a little without the threat of getting headshot by a cheater from across the map.",positive
"Wish there was a middle ground for review recommendations. Overall fun game when not dealing with too many bugs. I have more hours on GOG and have beaten the game. Still needs work and optimization for those that don't have high end gaming PC or laptops. A-Life still needs fleshing out, feels very basic and bare bones. Otherwise I feel neutral about recommending it. Really up to what one is looking for.",positive
"I really wish this game didn't just have a recommend/don't recommend option since my feelings are pretty mixed but overall I think for some people this game is well worth a play or two or three or four.

If your game crashes during compiling shaders or first load like mine did, you have to put your machine into power saver and then it works fine - except the game will run at 25-50 fps which is not fine.

The story, world, atmosphere are all fabulous. The running around for minutes or tens of minutes without much interesting stuff going on is not so fabulous. I thought it started really slow, I only enjoyed the game after putting in 6-8 hours which is way too long for the game to rope you in, I only put up with it because I loved the other games and really wanted to finish this one.

The enemies on veteran feel unrewarding to play against. They're either really dumb and unaware, or they wallhack and shoot you through walls. Towards the end of the game due to their armours you have to shoot each and every one of them 3-4 times in the head before you get a kill, and in the very last level you add 2 more headshots because of a level-specific mechanic, which is quite infuriating.

If you are a fan of the series you have to play this one, it's a love letter to all the other games.",positive
توقعات مذهله للعبة ولاكن للاسف فقدت اهم عنصر وهو المتعة -اللعبة غير ممتعة -لن اشتري لعبة من هذا الاستوديو مجددا,negative
"The timestamp doesn't seem to work, 8:14
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7n8UfM_gXEE&t=493s If they put the guy who's a bloodsucker in this video, into the game as an easter egg cosplaying to scare his drunk mates and almost getting shot after being rifle butted, I could probably overlook all the terrible things the game and give it a 10 out of 10 for the easter egg alone lol. 

HOWEVER, this is not to say I haven't enjoyed what the game HAS offered thus far. Because it would be a lie to say I haven't. 

- I love the atmosphere
 
- The graphics are of course nice 

- The music and ambience are suitable

- The story is reasonable, although, some things were predictable (still better than fallout 4's story and ubitrash farcry games)

- The mutants were indeed fear inducing, especially the chimera and the controller

- The locations are mapped out differently than the original games but still look the same when you arrive at them which is nice 

Now what could be improved / added is the following:

- The optimisation is terrible, like, you'd think having above the recommended requirements (I have the rec RAM, an i5-12600k being 11% better than rec cpu and 4070 Super being 36% better than rec gpu according to benchmark site) would be more than enough to run the game well on ultra, sadly not (although, as long as LOD's are good, I don't care too much for the most realistic graphics)
 
- A-life, which they ARE working on, and too many crybabies can't wait and therefore dismiss the game (it really isn't S.T.A.L.K.E.R without it, it's more like trashcry from ubitoss but in a S.T.A.L.K.E.R atmosphere - and yeah I hate ubisoft if that isn't obvious lmao)
 
- Binoculars and NVG for crying out loud

- The skinning of mutants! Like come on GSC, why are they there in the first place, cannon fodder?

- Better weapon balance, as of now, the only weapons worth using are the scoped AK you get at the start of the game, and the semi automatic shotgun, the rest really are quite redundant (for example, the scoped SVD has the same zoom level as the scoped AK, and ammo for it doesn't come often, yet there is an abundance of AK rounds, the AK can have a 45 round mag, and other superior attachments, so why use the SVD?)

- Better ITEM balance, like holy smokes, I end up with 50 bandages/vodka/medikits etc, and they also heal too quick etc, even on veteran! It makes the game too easy, same with the amount of ammo you find. This IS an apocalypse you know? This is what Misery Mod/Anomaly for the original games got right. Although to be fair, I never played the original games vanilla, so maybe I'm too used to S.T.A.L.K.E,R being a hardcore milsim

There's probably other stuff I could add, but this outlines the basics. Most of the issues I listed CAN be fixed / improved with mods, so the game experience can certainly be made to meet better standards. I can only recommend it, if you get it at a low price, it really isn't worth 90 AUD. That's not to say that it won't be. GSC have constantly been putting out patches and I have faith that the game can only become what it should be. Regardless, we have modders who do wonders anyway.",negative

"Stalker 2 offers an immersive experience, particularly excelling in its atmosphere and graphics. However, it falls short in several key areas, most notably with the a-life system that initially set it apart from other titles. This aspect will be the primary focus of my review. Regrettably, the a-life system appears to be broken and does not operate as intended. The AI consistently knows your location, which significantly diminishes the sense of immersion. As a result, the game world feels static and lifeless, drawing comparisons to a typical Ubisoft open-world game. There is a distinct lack of dynamic interactions, and players encounter very few NPCs throughout their journey. Rather than existing throughout the environment, the AI spawns only within specific ranges, leading to a lack of offline persistence, as they vanish once outside this range. Moreover, I encountered severe issues with quest progression, experiencing heavy softlocks in three different areas. Overall, these shortcomings detract from the game's potential, ultimately hindering the overall experience for players.",negative
as of right now the game crashes all the time. play at your own risk until they do a lot more patching.  about 40 hours in is when it really started crashing a lot. save as much as possible,negative
"Amazing game after installing some mods to improve the AIM sensitivity and the overall performance of the game. After that, its been one of the most fun games i have played in a while. Worth every dollar.",positive
" A bit rough around the edges, but a fun game besides that. I am having fun!",positive
"I can't even run it without it looking like a watercolor painting, despite having above the minimum specifications on the lowest graphical settings. The AI is botched and as repeated time and time again - the A-Life system isn't just broken, it's nonexistent. The entire Stalker 2 experience feels like an overly ambitious revival project that went awry using the Unreal Engine 5 without any sort of meaningful optimization, instead banking on the sheer brute force power of modern gaming rigs to make up the difference.

I don't recommend this game, not in it's current state. Not even for Stalker fans that know what they're getting themselves into, because they deserve better than that. Never should a game rely on the merits of modding community that might not even exist, because modders typically only make mods for games they love. They don't (typically) make mods for games they *might* love.

If you want to see the fate of games that were meant to thrive from a modding community instead of the game's own merits, one only needs to look at a certain space faring rpg.",negative
It's exactly what I've been wanting from a S.T.A.L.K.E.R game. Very much worth the wait,positive
"DO NOT BUY. Don't be an idiot like me and support a game that expects $59 for something broken and endlessly frustrating. Yes, I have barely any time in the game but that is because I waited for 2 months and 2 patches for the devs to fix the things everyone was complaining about:

>A.I. being trash and enemies obnoxiously respawning
>BROKEN KEY CONFIGURATION
>Many bugs, including game-breaking bugs and crashes

So after the first major patch described these as being fixed I jumped in. Right away I encountered bullet-sponge enemies (the laziest way to increase difficulty) and F@%#D KEY CONFIGURATION. 

The issues with key configuration really grind my teeth. Being able to custom bind keys has been around since the dawn of gaming itself, yet too many devs simply don't give a rat's anus about getting it right. Yes, it's TWO months after their ""1.0 release"" and TWO patches, yet I have actions not binding correctly and other actions double-binding, like swinging the knife every time I push 'v' to sprint. It's unacceptable. 

Add to this the gaming forums filled with people complaining that the A.I. is still trash and that game-breaking bugs remain ubiquitous and I didn't bother playing the game beyond a couple hours.

I'm only writing this review to add my negative review to the pile. This game does NOT deserve the praise it has gotten. What a joke when devs are so incompetent that they expect a AAA price while delivering such a mangled abortion. Yes, you can't even configure your keys without issue. What a joke. 

Do devs ever fire people over incompetency like this? Is there ever a time when a boss says, ""well, Bob""--or in this case--""well, Vlad... you were expected to code for key configuration and you FAILED. Here is your 30 day notice of termination.""

I don't think so. I'm starting to think such things never happen among gaming devs. Games limp along for months (or even years) after release before getting fixed- well past the time they have effectively ruined the gameplay experience for all those who eagerly gave them money.

So please. Don't give GSC Game World your money. They don't deserve it.

"Steam needs to go to a star system, or at least allow a ""neutral"" score for reviews. I can't recommend this game, but I do enjoy it. This is a straight down the middle 2.5- 3 out of 5 for me. The overall design and aesthetics are fine, but they feel like a STALKER coat of paint on a FARCRY game. If graded as a stand-alone game or outside the STALKER series it is a passable game with some glaring issues. When graded as a STALKER game it doesn't hold up. 

I have played every STALKER title, and this is by far the least satisfying. It feels like they over promised, got pushed into a release by Microsoft, tried to cater to console players, and released an early access game as a full price AAA title. The early reviews were very positive, but many came from first time players, console users, and game pass players. Now that it is over 90 days since launch most players seem to be grading it as a STALKER title, instead of as FARCRY Chernobyl.  

The complete absence of A-Life is the most significant reason why it isn't an acceptable STALKER game. Instead of persistent NPCs with their own schedules and goals we got an 80 meter (now 100) bubble around the player where random NPCs spawn. This would be disappointing but tolerable if they hadn't promised A-life 2.0 or if this was a single title with no previous expectations. Whether it was the unreal engine, the war, Microsoft pushing them, or whatever other reason it doesn't matter. What was promised was an improvement (or at least a continuation) of one of the better AI systems in the last 20 years. What was delivered was subpar for any RPG, let alone STALKER.

Some of the game-play mechanics that are in fact present are not well implemented and feel like they were watered down for mass market appeal.  Other things like the ballistics just make no sense and feel like they were made to make the game progress at the speed they wanted vs. based on anything remotely resembling physics. An SMG in 9x18mm is as or more powerful than a full length rifle chambered in 7.62 or .556. The repair costs and weapon degradation rates make just roaming the zone difficult. The lack of good loot in stashes and no loot on mutants really takes away from the zone too. This game really requires a ballistics and weapon repair rate/cost mod to be playable. I can't play it in an un-modded state. Spending thousands of coupons to repair my AR15 that is at 50% condition after dumping under 300 rounds to kill a handful of lootless mutants is just not fun. 

The bugs are bad, but expected. My standards for any studio releasing a finished game have dropped in recent years. My expectations for getting a bug-free STALKER title were super low before that. The problem I have is that previously other STALKER titles traded stability for an innovative engine/experience. This game has all the bugs but none of the features. 

The unpolished form in which the game released was ""CYBERPUNK level"" bad. So far, much like CYBERPUNK, the devs have been showing commitment to fixing the game. I am concerned that recently there has been talk about DLC and adding major features, yet the main mechanic of the game is still absent. I hope that moving forward they will focus on getting the game to a point where it at least has some semblance of an A-life system. If a DLC drops before working A-life, all hope is lost for anything but modders fixing the game.

This game is enjoyable if you download a few mods and pretend it isn't supposed to be the next STALKER game. 3 out of 5.

Also the game looks fantastic especially the anomalies effects and the whole experience is very immersive BUT everything is ruined by the very bad optimisation. I had actually waited for 2 months from release before starting playing so I didn't had many bugs or crashes but there were a couple of the along the way. The game is a lot more playable than on release but I have to say that is the minimum to be playable and actually enjoyable. The game still has a lot of optimisation that it needs, but i think it heading in the right direction.

Gameplay wise... Honestly, I'd say get the previous STALKER games and mod them, it's cheaper and requires a little bit of work for what is effectively going to be the same payout. Not much has changed, there's a rudimentary stealth system that is honestly kind of crap, and there's next to no new mutants or anything. 

You're effectively paying a premium (or more if you want the digital deluxe editions, lmao) to walk the entire zone in a terrible engine managed by dorks. Avoid this for now.

The setting, the gameplay loop etc is already gripping, can't wait to see how the game further develops, both with support from devs and mod community. Some of the mods on the older games are absolutely packed with tailored content, and this game (while solid on its own) will be an amazing platform.

"Firstly, I’d like to say that I have fond memories playing the first two Stalker games.
They weren’t perfect. They could be a little unstable at times but they were really atmospheric and a lot of fun to play, which far outweighed any bugs or crashes you might experience from time to time.

However, after 40 hours trying to play this addition to the franchise, I’m done with this game.
I just can’t be bothered with all of this. It’s not worth my sanity.

Many of the hours I’ve spent trying to enjoy this game have been marred by the many issues which I've experienced with both my pc and Steam, since installing this… thing.

Even after giving this game the benefit of the doubt, I’ll still say that over all the decades I’ve been gaming, this has to be one of the most frustrating games, if not the most frustrating game, I have ever installed.

I can run Cyberpunk 2077 on high settings with not one issue. Resident Evil Village? No problem.
Metro Exodus Enhanced Edition, Days Gone, Baldur’s Gate 3, Spider-Man, Star Wars: Squadrons, Street Fighter 6, Total War… and many, many more titles, with very few to zero issues whatsoever.
But this… Out of the 12 days or so that I’ve tried getting into this game, only two sessions have gone without any fault. Two!?!

I've spent so much time troubleshooting.

It started with installing the game, it seemed pretty good. Then, after an update the same evening, it developed shader issues. Then it refused to load any saves.
When, after two more days, I finally seemed to iron-out those issues, enough to be able to play. The CTDs began.
Windows has been affected on more than one occasion and I was locked out of Steam after another crash today, which I’ve just managed to sort out after about an hour of having the authenticator tell me it needed a code from itself. WTF?!?

Coincidence?… I just don’t care now.

I’ve decided to throw in the towel. This game is just not that compelling for me to keep fighting to enjoy it.

It may not be problematic for many of you who are enjoying it. And I very much hope it stays that way for you.
But I’m joining the list of those warning people of how unstable this game can be. And it would appear to be happening regardless of where your pc might sit on the high or low end of the graphics spectrum.

This game needs help... I feel like I might need help after all this.

Awesome honeymoon phase but the experience gets progressively worse the more you play, except for very very good UKR voice acting and cinematics that consists through the entire game.

"Pros:
-The first hours of gameplay were filled with quests.
-Prices for buying supplies, bullets, repairing armor, weapons, and upgrading them are very expensive. This makes you live like a stalker, not a millionaire.
-I liked the main questline, which has four different endings. In my opinion, this is enough for AAA project.
-Artifact hunting is really cool.
-Anomalous areas (like Poppy Field).

Cons:
-Using Unreal Engine 5 was a mistake. Due to the engine's high requirements, I get 30-40 FPS in the open world with an RTX 2070 Super & Ryzen 5 3600.
-There are plenty of empty buildings, locations lack side quests. 
-A lot of walking. I assume that half of my playtime is just walking from one point to another.
-A-Life 2.0 is just a script that randomly spawns enemies or monsters every 10-15 minutes.
-Bots are extremely stupid.
-Equipment balance is terrible. The best weapons and armor are given in the main questline, so what's the point of exploring the Zone?
-Poor illumination. The gamma is very dark, and the flashlight does not create shadows—even campfires don't.
-The reputation system is poorly implemented.
-The graphics are on the same level as Fallout 4.
-There are zero animations, even for simple actions such as putting on a gas mask, paying a vendor, or opening a door.
-It's sad that the game does not contain areas where scientific armor—with its protection against radiation, temperature, or toxic gases—could be more useful than just bullet resistance.
-NPCs have very unemotional facial expressions during dialogues. Their faces feel lifeless, making conversations dull and immersion-breaking.

"The core gameplay, atmosphere and ""stalker"" feeling is there, but there is still much work to be done on the game. The game requires quite a beefy PC. There were several game breaking bugs/glitches that were fairly easy to fix, as well as many smaller ones.

It was fun overall, wouldn't say it's worth the full price, but they have been steadily updating it and maybe with a few more months of work it will be. I'd recommend the game overall, but maybe wait more time for it to get polished first.",positive
"First and foremost, this game's optimisation is horrible. Compiling shaders every launch and continuous crashes - and no it's not my hardware. It's crashed my entire PC several times.

NPCs are pinpoint accurate against the player, but are incapable of hitting each other. They also do near-zero damage to other NPCs, including mutants such as dogs, and make no attempt to aid the player if they're attacked while in a ""safe"" area, where you can't pull a gun.

Mutant enemies are ridiculously tanky, often taking 3-4 mags from high-calibre weapons to drop them. This is on top of the fact that most Mutants are either invisible or have a shield that only goes away on it's own for seconds at a time, while they continue to attack you unabated. You can't say this is to encourage stealth approaches as stealth does not function as a mechanic, it often causes NPCs to bug out, and the amount of weapons in the game is conflict to the approach they want you to take with them. Can't hand me an automatic shotgun and expect me to never use it in favour of a dinky Makarov.

Many quests are outright broken and cannot be resolved.

Anomalies are so poorly programmed that they really shouldn't even be in the game, and they're so common you spend the entire game throwing bolts wherever you go. That's not gameplay, that's annoying.

The game spends a lot of time restricting you from having any player agency. There are many areas where you're flat out not allowed to kill someone even if that person is marked for a kill quest. Your gun has magic malfunctions whenever you try. In many quests you're presented with A or B choices, with a C choice implied, but you can never actually do the C. For instance there's a quest where you either destroy or gather data from scanners. If you recover the data then destroy the scanner, hoping for a resolution, the quest bricks.

Voice acting is subpar for English, the accents are all over the place. I had someone describe the voices to me as ""An American pretending to be a Brit pretending to be an Australian"". Metro had English dialogue with Russian accents, why not do that here?

I can load up an old save, but after a while the HUD just disappears and nothing will bring it back.

- Pressing ESC to get the settings menu, and pressing it again
- Changing the UI settings from ""Enabled"" to ""Disabled"", saving, reloading and changing it back
- Using UETools - Developer Console mod from NexusMods
- SolidShadow's Toggleable HUD from Nexus mods

"honestly the worst game that I have ever tried to play - the more they update the more issues with both intel, Nvidia, and the developers. at least 150 crash reports and when I finally tune things, either nvidia or devs push an update and I have to start all over again making this garbage work on a top of the line gaming PC 

why is everything so garbage",negative
"There is A LOT of walking in this game, you have to walk everywhere, fast travel is a joke, being only limited to a few points around the map, that you have to walk to and from. You get encumbered very easily, only by taking with you ammo, healing items and a few weapons. The types of monsters in this game can be counted on the fingers of one hand and they're all bullet sponges, I would have hoped for more diversity, but every important quest has the same type of monster that you need to kill. The mechanic of finding artifacts feels tedious, takes a lot of time and  requires even more walking, it's horrible. I'm very far into the game because I wanted to explore Pripyat, but 60 hours in and I'm still not there yet. I don't recommend this game in it's current state, it feels like a beta.",negative
"The game has a very atmospheric setting, along with a solid plot and enjoyable gameplay.",positive
runs like hot garbage nearly a half of a year later. Just sail the seas for this one folks this probably will never get any better dispite clickbait on youtube you may see.. my laptop can run cyberpunk on high but cant run this russians in arkansas type game is a damn shame.,negative
"[h2][b][i]Lets drink to him once more, he was a good STALKER[/i][/b][/h2]

This game is just a [u][b]shell[/b][/u] of what the STALKER trilogy once was.

Its exhaustingly boring, just sad really. 

The story [b]doesnt care[/b] about the trilogy and is [b]packed with plotholes, retcons and just plain nonsense.[/b]

[h1]No A-Life and exploration isnt really rewarding. Unless you want that 54067th sausage and bread in a row[/h1]

[b]It doesnt feel like STALKER at all, its like someone aquired the rights to the game and just made a homemade Unity clone.[/b]

Im not even going to talk about how broken the game is because thats what its most known for already. Abolute MESS.

Think of it like the Halo trilogy. This is basically Halo 5.

[h3]Buy this game in like 2 years when the STALKERS have modded the game to a playable state.[/h3]

This was my Ted talk, thank you for enduring",negative
"Very interesting game, but requires a very powerful PC.",positive
"As Veteran of Stalker Franchise, this game is straight up disappointment.

Where to even begin with...I did play this game on launch. Many issues that comes to performance, AI, no A-Life, Weapon Conditions going down too fast compare to its X-Ray Trilogy games.

Map was made to be 1:1 in real life with sadly resulted in fucking up whole lore that was behind X-Ray Timeline (Due to X-Ray Trilogy being of course canon to Stalker 2).

Places feel too empty due to lack of A-Life (it was added later on in next updates but it's weak compared to one from X-Ray Trilogy).

A lot of weapons that didin't make it to Stalker 2 like Black Kite, Protecta and many more.

Story is...weird, confusing at times, after beating the game still I could't understand ANYTHING at all.

To close this review I can say, this game wasn't made for deep fans of stalker but only for new people that will happly spend money due to hearing that stalker 2 has been finally avalible to buy after many, many delays.

I will just stick to X-Ray Trilogy and mods.",negative
"IMO, I can't recommend the game in the current state. Feels like it needs more time to be fleshed out, among which are:
1.Economy
It could use a little love, IMO. Small bump in radiant quests, if one's in green with given faction.
2. Weapon balance
I, once, run into pseudo-giant. Before that, I found an RPG7 with three rockets. Was it enough to kill it? No. Hell, even when I shot point-blank at myself, it didn't kill me.",negative
"As a fan of the original trilogy and 200hrs on STALKER GAMMA I can very much recommend Heart of Chornobyl. 
Performance-wise the game went through a lot. Even after the first big patch it was really nerve-wrecking expirience. The fps drops and crashes. In its current state it is somewhat better, so we can easily see, the devs are doing something to fix it.
Otherwise, this game is a gem. Graphics, ambience are very good. Gunplay somewhat lacks in my opinion (if I was a developer I would use inspiration from GAMMA where it is more like Tarkov). Enemies sometimes act like braindead kids so that could use some adjusting. The Zone feels somewhat empty from time to time and the game is a walking simulator (got used to that from GAMMA anyways).
Story is where it shines. 10/10 is not enough. Maybe it is because I am familiar with the story. Maybe its just me. But only 3 games left me empty hearted after the credits. Red Dead Redemption 2, Witcher 3 and Stalker2. I even cried twice XD.

P.S. If its going to recieve as much love as GAMMA did, we have something to look forward to",positive
"At the time this review is written (feb 2025) I am unable to recomand Stalker 2. 
The game still runs very very bad ( for note, I am using a 4070 as card and have 32 GB of ram) and I would be lucky if I get 60 FPS. 
There are also some questionable desing chooise in it. 
The animations that are played when you heal are really annoying and seeing as much you have to heal yourself, it get old really fast. 
The flashlight is not good at all and as there is no nightvision yet, it is the only source of light for you. 
To not just be negative, the zone is very pretty to look at. 
There is no questons that the UE5 is doing a fine job showing how it would look like. 
The gunfights are really fun at times and there is so much things to do. 
You can just walk around and then you find a path that you have not notice before. 
Just go and explore and find things is great.

If they can make the game run better and give more quailty of life encahnced to it, I would recomand it. 
For now, I can't.

"Hi Guys, 
I have played about 103.5 hours in-game until now the game takes so much RAM and I can not play anymore, 
do u have a solution for this problem???
Thanks",positive
"Really good game in general. I've not played Stalker before but it feels like a mix of a ton of different games of different generes like RPGs, FPS etc. Would definitely recommend. Only criticism is that it can be a running simulator at times.",positive
"I bought this on steam deck knowing full well it wouldnt work well. And I bought the most expensive version on Xbox.I wanted in some small way to stand with Ukraine, with their people. maybe it didn’t make a difference ill never really know. but to me its in trying in the small ways that says something. Idk.  And as for the game? It’s pretty cool at least to me. I’ve always been more geared to a Skyrim or devs ex etc, but S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2 &Kingdom come Deliverance have really opened my eyes to survival/narrative focused adventures. I do wish tho  that some of the mutants weren’t so tanky.",positive
"How many more patches do you guys need to fix memory issues? 
I just can't finish the game because it just crashes when I need to kill GRANIT. The same place everytime.. with different graphic settings. So what? 16GB of RAM is suddenly not enough? It was enough for the whole game but now its not?
Seriously, such low quality stuff shoud never get to PROD.",negative
"Great game, great atmosphere, very scarry in some places. It follows the 2012 game ideas and I appreciate it a lot. Enjoyed 90% of my time playing it. 

Things to improve:
- Add ablity to climb things (now you can only jump on stuff which is stupid sometimes for a mordern game)
- Make boss fights less arcade/grindy: usually you get to arena, and there no other way to kill boss (especially mutant) except then by spending the whole ammo+hp supply. Maybe it's because Veteran difficulty isn't balanced enough.
- adding to the point above: getting less ammo and less medkits together with less tanky mobs will be a good balance tweak for Veteran difficulty
- AI is so-so, can be improved. Sometimes too ""eagle eye-ed"", but still quite stupid",positive
I love this game. It is definetly my new favorite survival shooter. It will be perfect once all the glitches and bugs are fixed. I am looking forward to the patch that solves all the lag no matter what my graphics settings are set to lol. Running a RTX 2070 and I feel like it should be pulling this game much better.,positive
"Overall great game, a lot of details BUT...the ""realism"" BS they throw in is EXTREMELY ANNOYING! You have to eat constantly, and drink energy drinks to have enough stamina to run more than 50 yards. Come on now... Traveling from point to point on the map is painfully time consuming. I get it, people want realism with games but this is just absurd. Some things should be left out to increase the enjoyability of a game. I'd recommend this to others for the sheer detail the programmers put it into it, but overall in my opinion they ruined the gameplay with the ""realism"".

UPDATE after playing some more.

This game is absolute trash, an extreme waste of time. Save points suck you'll get killed for seemingly no reason and be set way back unless you're on top of your manual saves, and you will grow old and miss your kids growing up just getting from one point on the map to another.",positive
"I’ve been obsessed with it ever since I booted it up, and honestly, everything about it just clicks for me. You drop into this massive, creepy open world set in the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone, and it’s like stepping into a post-apocalyptic dream. The vibes are unreal—the graphics are so damn good it’s like I’m actually there, trudging through the muck with the wind howling and the sky turning all freaky during an emission. Every sound, from the distant mutant growls to the clatter of my AK, just pulls me deeper into the Zone. I love how it makes me feel like I’m on edge all the time, like anything could go down, and I wouldn’t have it any other way.

The gameplay? Oh, it’s pure gold. I’m running around scavenging for artifacts, tweaking my guns with all these badass mods, and picking sides with factions like it’s some gritty survival soap opera. The whole deal with managing hunger, radiation, and all that jazz—it’s tough as nails, but that’s why I’m hooked. It doesn’t hold your hand, and I respect the hell out of that. The story’s got me wrapped up too; playing as Skif, making choices that actually matter and lead to different endings, it’s like I’m carving out my own legend in this messed-up world. I’ve already lost track of how many hours I’ve sunk into exploring every corner of that 64-km² map, and I’m still finding new stuff to geek out over.

Sure, I’ve heard some folks griping about bugs and frame drops, and yeah, I’ve seen a glitch or two myself. But honestly, I don’t give a damn—those little hiccups don’t touch what makes this game so freaking awesome for me. The devs are patching it up anyway, and I’m just over here living my best life in the Zone. The atmosphere, the tension, the freedom—it’s everything I’ve ever wanted from a S.T.A.L.K.E.R game, cranked up to eleven. If you’re like me and you dig a challenge wrapped in a world that’s equal parts gorgeous and terrifying, this is it. I’m already itching to dive back in and see what else I can stir up. Absolute banger of a game, no question.",positive
"Id recommend it because it's definitely a fun game.
However the gameplay just doesn't draw me like the previous games did. I didn't have the draw to keep exploring new places to see what I might find and who I might meet.

Overall kinda disappointed, hopefully it gets better with updates",positive
Bring back a-life and i will change my review!,negative
"Purchased the Ultimate Edition but it's very annoying like the rest of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games. (I own them all).
It has bad gunplay, mediocre graphics with sluggish and frustrating gameplay. The tutorial is nonexistant.
Wish I could refund this overhyped garbage. It's nothing like on the trailers, the thrill is lacking. Get Metro games instead.",negative
good game,positive
"One of the best experiences. The atmosphere, immersion, and the level of challenge is top notch.  Bugs are there, but few and far between and none were game breaking for me or even immersion breaking. The patches have been rolling in and i think anyone worried will be fine, however it is a graphically demanding game but beautiful. True gamer game, slower paced and forces you to accept the long journeys between places, but that's the fun in it. The formula only replicated by games like Skyrim where you never know when you're going to run into something insane or horrifying or amazing. Absolutely awesome story. Im 60 plus hours in game and only half way through, and they plan on adding DLC. Very happy first day supporter and have played all the previous games. Dont listen to the COD twitchers complain, the squishy new generation just wants pink and blue hair types and gold guns. Worth every penny get this game. 10/10",positive

My rating, 8/10


If there was no bugs (or 90% less) and everything was working as it should..  it would have been at least 9/10.

"Overall I think this game is in a decent place now and very playable. Interesting  and engaging story and mechanics. Does have some big bugs, like enemies only spawning in a radius around you and not actual ""live world"". Playing it though, it's not super noticeable now. There is also a memory leak in Rostok area still that will crash you, however I think the devs will fix that soon, they have been working hard. AI 2 is not great but serviceable. 

Side note: I listened to some of the British translation for this game, and it's hilariously bad.",positive
"Fantastic survival FPS. Great story, difficult but rewarding. Its good to run!",positive
"I'd heard the whispers of the original games' cult following and am a fan of some of the games that they've influenced, and I gotta say, it's really great to get my hands on a freshly modernized iteration of it. It's sort of like if the Fallout games were made for more hardcore/jaded gamers, wherein the word ""survival"" in the game's genre actually carries weight beyond its rustic aesthetic design. For example, the mutant wildlife don't drop any loot so they exist only to harass you, and waste your ammo and meds, and the game has an active death counter on the game over screen sort of akin what some Soulslike games do, because it knows you're going to die, and die a lot. Such is to say: it definitely ain't gonna hold your hand, but the story and lore and all that depth you'd want from this type of experience is all there. If this title seems interesting to you, I highly recommend you check it out! (also the devs are Ukranian)",positive

runs like shit with input lag beyond any game ive ever played,negative
"Good game, easy story to follow. I has fun :D",positive
"Great potential with MANY flaws to be worked on.
One of the fantastic story in its list, astonishing graphics, but the story ends there.

Many have pointed critics out, and I am just another in the community who will recap the impressions:
A-life features have not been implemented yet, NPCs are not A-life nor the mutants, nor the UI in the missions where it flickers as of version 1.2.

Right now, in my opinion, it is not worth to buy the game full price nor the partial price of it. GSC Game World need to work on playability and its game foundation to be stable such as no memory leaks, both for RAM and VRAM, no stutters in civilized areas, no frame drops in populated areas. Explain if file paging is needed in your support page, or as part of FAQ.

NPCs do not have natural moves and thats something to have a look at.
We would love to see your roadmap on further development of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2.
Take this critics as constructive, dont take this personally. You have already achieved to be in the Steam Awards participation. Get yourself to work to get another Steam Award this year. Good luck out there!

P.S. The game is not playable at the Red Fortress, sooooo, another reason the game is not recommended.",negative

"This was my entry into the STALKER series. By no means would I call this a perfect game, but it's a game that gripped me enough that I played 61 hours in a bit over a week. There was only a couple of spots that I found particularly rough, and otherwise I had a great experience.

Looking forwards to doing more runs when they patch the game further!",positive
HELL YEAHHH!!!,positive
Love it.,positive
"This game having a $90CAD price tag after tax and releases in a buggy unfinished state. As I played through the game I progressively got more and more annoyed after the halfway point of the game as bugs began appearing more frequently and it started to turn into a skeleton of a game the more I played through it. The only thing this game has going for it still, for the most part, are the graphics and the world design. Patches still haven't fixed most bugs as some still exist since launch. This game should have been delayed another 2 years and is another example of large studios releasing unfinished products at full price. Completely unacceptable.",negative
"As of 1.2 game is not finished. A-life not implemented, very sparse sidequest content after garbage, mutant AI needs a re-work, weapons need a little work to make them feel more different from each other and a few other minor problems.

So its not ready to be played, the problem is the main quest is fully implemented so you can complete the game but get an incomplete experience. So if they resolve all these issues and you replay it to get the full experience you will have already spoiled the main plot for yourself.

So if you want to have the cheekiest of breekis you're just gonna have to wait a little longer.",negative
"A worthy successor to the series that retains the feel and grit of the previous titles. The Zone is still mysterious and dangerous, the world still dilapidated.

The story is so-so and the English voice acting is pretty terrible overall and doesn't fit at all. After switching to the Ukrainian version with subtitles it is, however, spot-on. 

On medium difficulty you scrounge up insane amounts of supplies and ammo with moderate exploration. Increasing the difficulty will lower the amount of supplies you get (great), but also make enemies more sturdy (lame). If the medium difficulty would give around 30% less supplies overall I think it would hit the sweet spot.

In any case, recommended if you want a modern successor true to the originals with quite a lot less jank, though it's still there.
Not recommended if you are averse to walking around the desolate wasteland and taking it all in. There will be stretches where not much is going on, which is how it should be.",positive
Ending was buggy asf,negative
"Ignore the vast majority of negative reviews!. They are almost entirely from the game's launch which admitingly was pretty awful. The game has since seen substantial updates and fixes to 90% of the worst bugs and poor optimizations.

Now on with my personal review. Gonna be a long one if your really that interested, Skip to summery if not.
The most important question is ""Is it fun?"" Answer: Why yes, it is fun now that it's cleaned up. By no means perfect, not even close to the old GAMMA STALKER. But still I had a great time start to finish.

The setting and atmosphere are top shelf quality. It feels so immersive and good, even randomly walking around the middle of no where still has that feeling that just hits the right balance of beautiful, depressing and terrifying all at once. You are hard pressed to find many games that the world it'self just sucks you in. Clearly this was the Devs #1 focus, and they nailed it.

There is a lot to explore, and I've come to find out there is a insane amount of content hidden right under your nose, and you won't even notice if your not paying attention. Dude looking through some Binocs? maybe he actually sees something. And low n behold he was, and is now shooting at you for stealing what he was scouting out. Steal a note from a bag ment to help newbies and travelers? the owner in the near by town will complain to his pals about someone stealing it, no interaction with the player required. BUUUUT, despite a lot of little hidden gems, the game has a noticeable lack of meaningful content a lot of the time. Theres a thousand stashs you can loot and wisely, some have blueprints to weapon and armor upgrades to encourage stash hunting. But 95% of said stashes are filled with absolute junk that only leaves you disapointed at best.

Gun fights feel pretty good with other human NPCs, AI isn't great, and their shotguns are sniper rifles in their hands. Fighting mutants though, uhg, it's bad. Not only are they massive bullet sponges that take 2 or 3 mags to kill, they offer ZERO loot, you are punished to fighting them essentially. Bloodsuckers are lorewise a rare and deadly mutant to run into, here they are everywhere, and in packs, and are just as deadly. Only saving grace you can hope for, is a small box or burned out car you can stand on, as their AI does not allow them to jump up and get you (Though as deadly as they are and especially in packs, its almost is a good thing really). Love the danger factor of Mutants, DESPISE the massive health and zero reason to ever face them willingly.

The story and general time required to play through it varies on the kinda person you are. It took me 116 hours to finish my first play through (Hardest difficulty). I took my time, especially early on to explore and see the game. I was bamboozled a few times into thinking the game was ending, just to find out I'm no where near the end. Story if just focused is long, and not in a bad way. Choices are few, but they do matter, which faction likes and which hates you early on, and towards the end your choices affect what ending you get, as well as which faction now hates or likes you. Though I'm a bit disappointed the CNPP (Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant) isn't really in the game as a place you go to, and Prypiat is rather short lived once you reach it, kinda feel they dropped the ball a bit there for two of the most famous locations of the region.

The game is missing a lot of features it's 2001 counterpart had that made it so unique. A lot of it isn't deal breaking or a major issue, its just there is a lot of little things missing that made STALKER, well... STALKER. Thankfully, some of it is being addressed by the Devs themselves, who in time will implement them, but thankfully, STALKER modding community is crazy good and crazy dedicated, so I expect in about 1 year after release the game (with modding) is gonna be actually pretty amazing.

Summery
STALKER 2 is a ""good"" game, not a great game, but good. It was definitely pushed out a bit too early initially. Still less buggy than anything Bethsoft has ever made. It has good bones and the foundation they've built for it has serious potential, so if your willing to wait a little longer, It's gonna turn into a legendary game, modders will make sure of that.",positive
"Bottom line, the game's not fun. There are bugs which I understand, but it's the bizarre design decisions the company that made the game chose that have cause me to write this review. I wanted to relive the original game which truth be told was flawed but also and maybe most importantly a FUN game. This is not fun, maybe someday when the bug patches are all complete we can get some rebalancing updates for the economy, stamina system, and enemy AI. Until then wait on this game or get it only on the deepest discount, DO NOT PAY FULL PRICE FOR THIS GAME!",negative

"The game trailer looks good, as for the game itself when starting it the game is extremely laggy, apparently you need mods for it to be better, fuck that I ain't spending 90 bucks on a game just to have to install mods and go to extra work for it to run smoothly, hell cyberpunk 2077 worked perfectly fine from day one, that didn't need any extra steps, maybe if they put stalker 2 on psn then obviously it will work better.",negative
"Seems like the major bugs have been fixed! I waited to buy this because the reviews were saying its way too buggy, but then I saw it had a pretty big update so I got it and I've only had to restart once because of a bug. Absolutely love this game! crazy fun!",positive
"Most of the reviews you see will be about graphics or optimization issues. The graphics are fine and I only crashed about once. The game is fun for a little bit but I got bored after.  Dialogue is lackluster, inventory system kind of sucks, and the world feels dead (it should have more random events). If you enjoy Fallout then you are not going to enjoy this. If you are looking for a russian nuclear-esqe open world survival game, I would recommend the Metro series.",negative
"I think the bones are there. The game just promised so much and the delivery left a sour taste in my mouth. There are a lot of people claiming the zone is ""empty"" and that it should feel desolate. I argue that we are playing a video game that is supposed to be fun. I didn't pay 60 bucks for a walking simulator where I am over encumbered after every mission if I want to try and sell anything of value. There are balancing issues (i.e the ai has literal auto aim and it makes gun fights not fun and more something to actively avoid) and of course the bugs that are still running rampant making the game impossible to play. I honestly think that if there wasn't such a dedicated fan base this game would have received a much worse reception and people may be more objective when addressing the shortcomings of the game. I will try to play it through in awhile when the A-life is better and I can't get stuck out of missions, hopefully this game will get the cyberpunk treatment. I just do not want this to become the norm. Companies shouldn't be putting out objectively unfinished games and expecting people to buy the games with the knowledge that fixes are coming later.",negative
"Despite my recommendation, there's a lot to love about this game, but it just still needs more time. Even though the latest update is much less buggy, the gameplay overall feels like its actively getting worse. Controllers and other mutants spam attacks and somehow became even more huge bullet sponges, every gun handles like it weighs 50lbs, and the controls feel like Skiv weighs 1,000lbs.",negative
"Just to start off, I'm enjoying this game. It's about as immersive an experience as you can get in modern gaming and I think it's a solid successor to the original series. Many like to wax nostalgia about the original series forgetting how awful the gun play was when compared to other FPS games in the same era. That's not to say they weren't great games, but they weren't perfect either. What they were though were solid bases for an amazing modding community. 

STALKER 2 is much more accessible than the original games, but you can crank up the difficulty and immersion if you wish (turning off certain UI, etc.) My biggest issue though is performance - this isn't unique to STALKER 2, it seems to plague everyone developing games on UE5. I certainly hope they figure that out as well as the A-Life. They have made a big deal about it but the older modded games AI is better, more alive in the world around you.

If you're thinking about getting this, please understand that unless you have a gigachad rig you will have to make compromises on the visuals to get playable framerates. Anything older than a high end 30 series card and you may want to hold off before making that purchase - but do your own research.",positive

"I bought Stalker 2 with high expectations, but I was massively let down. The game just feels… boring. The environment is pretty, and the graphics are nice, but that’s about where the good things end.

The gameplay loop, quest design, and overall feel of the game leave much to be desired. Most of the quests feel like repetitive fetch missions, and the world feels dead. not in the atmospheric, immersive way you’d expect given the setting, but in a way that makes it feel empty and lifeless. There’s little reason to explore, as most places that look interesting from a distance turn out to have nothing worthwhile when you get there.

Quests and dialogue feel more like chores than engaging experiences. You talk to someone, they send you somewhere, you retrieve an item or talk to someone else, and the cycle repeats. I struggled to feel invested in the story or the characters, as nothing really drew me in or made me care.

Overall, Stalker 2 is a major disappointment. While it has decent graphics, the gameplay and world design fail to create a compelling experience.",negative

I have now tested the game on a 3080,4070ti and a 5070 ti and all 3 have the same stuttering issues. This is a known issue and can be a bit improved with mods or .ini edits but that should not be the norm. 
I hope they get this issue under control in the future!",negative
"I preordered this game and I am playing it game since the release date. As for me this game is a total success. 
Yes there are still a lot of flaws, bugs, performance issues and glitches, but this game is with a huge open world and you can litereally go anywhere you want and do what you want. The atmosphere, graphics and story are awesome. 
This game will be better and better like Cyberpunk 2077 which is 4 years old and there was a patch not a long time ago. Of course the game cannot be perfect for everyone, but there are already a lot of mods and there will be more. As for me this game worth buying it. 
Hope the DLC`c will also be awesome.",positive
"It's a beautiful game with many issues. To my frustration, due to a bug I even had to noclip a certain section of the game to get to finish one of the endings of it. But aside from these inconveniences it is most importantly a wholehearted new STALKER game. Possibly even the best entry into the franchise if its many quirks are getting fixed.",positive
A-Life is a lie. NPC spawn in literally right behind you breaking any sense of immersion. The enemies have aim-bot and and this one time I was shooting at a guy in a watch tower and my bullets where hitting an invisible wall. This game fucking sucks I feel like I wasted 60 bucks and its such a shame because it they where so close to making a god game they just gave up on the AI.,negative
The great atmosphere,positive
"I had never played or even heard of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. franchise before the release of this game, but after hearing nothing but praise and witnessing the sheer excitement from dedicated fans, I decided to give it a shot. It took me some time to adapt to its world of anomalies and monsters, but just as I was starting to get into it, I ran headfirst into the game's glaring design flaws. 
The AI is utterly ridiculous and nonsensical. Enemies spawn in the most absurd locations and moments, their reactions feel unnatural—especially when hit by bullets—and they detect you from absurdly long distances no matter how well you try to stay hidden. Their accuracy is laughable yet frustrating, managing to eliminate you from a distance even when using close-range weapons. These AI issues are compounded by the sluggish movement of the player character, making every encounter feel unnecessarily frustrating. There are a few boss fights in the main story, each seemingly worse than the last. In fact, I can confidently say that the final fight is the worst-designed encounter I have ever experienced in a game. I could go on for paragraphs criticizing the game's design choices.
Performance-wise, the game becomes increasingly unstable as you approach the end of the main story, which strongly suggests that its release was rushed and forced. This lack of polish severely hampers the experience, making it clear that the game needed much more development time before being launched.
On the positive side, the locations are absolutely stunning, and the story is somewhat engaging—though heavily hindered by how it unfolds. The quest structure is tedious, forcing you to run across a massive map between NPCs who do nothing but send you to other NPCs. This wouldn't be as bad if stamina wasn't so aggressively punished by your inventory weight, leading to an overreliance on energy drinks just to get around.
Ultimately, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 is an unfinished product that needs a ton of patches before it can be considered truly playable. The core ideas and setting intrigued me enough to make me interested in this newly discovered universe, but the current state of the game completely ruined the experience.",negative
great game,positive
It seems like every update comes with new issues. The game was playable for me now within one minute of every startup the game freezes and crashes so it is unplayable.,negative
"Its a great game but the bugs and issues that plague this game just make it unplayable, don't get me wrong im waiting for the studio to release more patches and i know they're going through a tough time and all but i've literally just met squint and tried to leave his location and get hit with the worst fps and graphics issue ive ever seen. I am enjoying the game and all but im gonna put it on pause until more patches are released fixing said issues so we gamers can play this game.",negative
"Good game, has it's problems that need to be fixed but other than that a good time, warning the game is easy to start off with but will get harder after halfway.
",positive
"After recent patches it's playable and fun.  The sausage/bread/can food mechanic gets old.  It definitely has the eastern european ""Game treating you unfairly? Too bad"" gameplay loop though.  Overall, would say it's worth a buy if you like open world shooters.",positive
This Needs optimisation updates!!!!!!!!,negative
"I cant recommend it in the current state but it is a good game in my opinion

However, some key binds are broken are once you try to change them even going back to the previous settings they just stop working and you have to use the weapon wheel for those features

I dont get much input lag with frame gen like some others are reporting in their reviews, but even with my specs of an
I7 12700k
RX 7800 XT
32gb RAM DDR5
on max graphics the game flops around from 60-90 fps and its doubled by frame gen but it makes it look absolutely hideous, PS3 games looked better than how frame gen makes games look today, that alone makes me want to leave a negative review to be honest. 

TLDR, I think its good but considering UE5, FrameGen and a $80 CAD price tag i cant recommend this unfortunately but there is absolutely fun to be had here",negative
"I would say this is unplayable as it is currently(Four months after launch). The performance is abysmal. It feels sluggish, not in gameplay terms but in how the game actually runs. 60FPS does not feel like 60fps. It feels like 20fps with the amount of input lag you're constantly fighting against regardless of enabling frame generation, disabling frame generation, using low, high or medium settings or using upscaling.

The upscaling is terrible and a requirement to run this game. You cannot get a decent framerate without upscaling or frame generation. Frame generation should not be touched at all. It generates huge amounts of input lag to create fake frames where ultimately the only impact it has is, for all purposes, showing a bigger number in your fps counter with none of the benefits of that higher fps.

This is another example of Unreal Engine ""Jank"". Crappy performance, requires a bunch of options to be enabled to give fake ""performance gains"". Stop using Unreal Engine. It's such a crappy and incredibly badly optimized game engine. Stop resorting to upscaling as default to run games and now forcing frame generation.

I'm so sick of the constant lies from games journalists and game publishers/developers telling us games can reach ""60 fps"" but then the only means to reach this performance level is to literally halve your native resolution, upscale the resolution and then have the GPU ""guess"" the missing information in a scene which makes games in motion look blurry and, frankly, weird looking.

I'll take a game from the mid to late 00's over the crap we're given these days. They look much clearer and far better than the crap we're getting in garbage like this.

Game runs like crap and should be avoided for the next five years until we can brute force performance out of this POS with next generation hardware.",negative
"Now, with the patches up to 1.2.1, Stalker 2 is playable and feels like a real Stalker game. It's been a long time coming, and worth the wait. Nobody does grim like GSC. The game is still a bit janky, but that's part of the charm now; with gamebreaking bugs gone, and A-Life mostly working, the hilarious and scary surprises keep you playing just one more mission.",positive
"I have always been a huge fan of the Stalker serie and this game has been a incredible experience. Its really catches the atmosphere of the old stalker games there was made like 15+ years ago. The map layout is very well designed and its has integrated the old maps from the other stalker games into it. Stalker 2 offer a huge arsenal of weapons there can upgrade and modified in any any direction there suit you play style. This is this is probably the best singleplayer shooter game I played in years. Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl is a true masterpiece and I would recommend all to play this game.

Pros:
- Breathtaking graphic
- Highly detailed environment
- Amazing Story/Plot
- Huge open world
- Multiple endings
- Brilliant voice acting
- Excellent soundtrack
- Unique atmosphere
- Hardcore gameplay

Cons:
- Terrible optimized
- Serious performance issues
- Frequent Graphics glitches and bugs
- Huge framerate drop in some area
- Various technical issues
- Game breaking bugs
- Key config are horrible mapped",positive
Don't listen to the bad things about Stalker 2 on other reviews this is the best game i have ever played and i'v played a lot of games in 33 years. the modding part of stalker 2 fix's every problem people find.been some shocker AAA games lately Stalker 2 amazing modded the game into like a open world extraction shooter.Because this is my style post apocalyptic survival and this game IS THE BEST THING SO HAPPY gives me a break from the online stuff ZONE out so this game is the bomb in NEW ZEALAND.,positive
"the game is pretty cool, but unfortunately it is a console port. Wich means before you can play this game you will first need to try and fix the horrible mouse controls. It not only has weird ass mouse smoothing but also different sensitivity settings for x and y axis, becouse apparently even devs think you cant aim properly with a controller stick.... Unfortunatly thats baked in the game somehow and not easily fixed without downloading stuff. Wich in turn gets broken by the next update restarting the whole process.",negative

"Very great game so far, the dialouge and character development is excellent, however I do often crash, which has given my overall experience some letdowns, but so far it seems decent",positive
"Ultimately this was a good game, but there are a ton of bugs- even after the 1.2 Patch. Without using UE Tools there are at least 3 times that I can remember where the game would not advance. Additionally, the game is not very balanced towards the end. Granted, I was playing on the highest difficulty, but still it was asymmetrical to the point of not being that fun to play. I think another patch to actually fix all the bugs and re-balance the last 20% or so of the game would be ideal.",positive
"Fun and made me jump a few times. Just wish traversal was better. Run drink energy drinks, it's all I do sometimes",positive
"I'll keep it brief. If you've played the modpacks, this may not satisfy you, and you may want to wait for development tools to be released, and mods to be further along before buying. 

For everyone else, this game is really cool. You need a beast of a machine to play though.",positive
"Great Game that wraps up the Stalker series so far. People keep complaining about issues and bugs, I completed the game on a laptop that didn't even meet some of the minimum requirements for the game yet the only real issue I ran into was the technician at the end of the game didn't spawn so I had to thug out the final 2 missions with a broken exoskeleton, an unupgraded stalker suit, and nearly all broken weapons. 10/10 would recommend",positive
This game is now fully playable after patch 1.2. Its a great game and I am on to my second play through. Worth it.,positive
"Honestly felt like it was boring as high hell, decent gameplay loop and ""graphics"" but its a crutch for what it shouldve had been.",negative
This game is amazing,positive
"I do love the game, I havent had a chance to play previous titles but stalker 2 is an incredible game, but with pros always come cons
- tab menu is insanely buggy, same as quick binds, youre barely alive in a gunfight, want to heal? HELL NO because itll take away your gun and make you stand there like an idiot
- artifacts, some of them spawn inside inaccesable spaces, gas tanks, close off electrical stations, underground, etc
thats basically what ive witnessed during my play so far
still i really enjoy the game even with the countless bugs",positive
"UE5 kills yet another project.
what a shame.",negative
"Worst optimised game ive ever played. The war isnt an excuse, you added cigarettes that burn out but cant make the game run above 60fps on medium-high end pcs.",negative
"Only second review on Steam ever.  Worth it.  Game made me had dreams of the Zone,",positive
Nice,positive
good games,positive
Some QOL improvements over Pripyat especially but still has the feel (and fit and finish) of the STALKER games. If you liked any of the previous three you'll love it. If you didn't like the previous three I don't think this will change your view completely. It's worth a shot for anyone tbh.,positive
"The early release had performance and bug issues. Patches have fixed a lot of it, It does still require a bit more manual tuning of settings than casual gamers would like though. 
Otherwise is the game great. Aside from smaller grievances and early game bugs, the story line is in the spirit of the series. I would like more side-missions, but his should be resolved in promised DLCs.

"I have been playing FPS for 25 years.  Since the original ""Doom"".  I am incredibly disappointed with STEAM for allowing this game to be positioned as quality release.  I saw the 81,000 likes and i thought this must be good.  FPS releases in 2015 are more fluid and realistic.  STALKER 2 is a major disappointment.  Movement, combat and more.  Do not buy !!!  Waste of money.",negative

"3.6 Roentgen. Not great. Not terrible. 

I played the original 3 stalker games multiple times way back when they were released on CDs. Still have those CDs. This one just doesn't quite feel like SoC/CS/CoP.

The good: 
-For the most part the game was stable and only crashed twice for me. 
-This game looks very good. The locations, NPCs, mutants, weapon models, miscellaneous items, and characters in general look very nice.
-Interesting stash puzzles, which require some clue hunting.
-In-game radio has some really good tracks. Although I haven't heard the classic bandit radio tune... 
-Little details like frogs, spiders, snakes, birds, insects, etc make the whole zone feel ""alive"".
-[spoiler]All of the locations from previous games +some new ones are in this one game and are open for exploration almost immediately. You can just go anywhere and do anything at almost time throughout the main story line[/spoiler].
-Lots of new in-game items as well as some of the old classics. [spoiler]No AN-94 Abakan this time though...[/spoiler]

The bad:
-Quest/achievement progression bugs are still in the game, which is very annoying. 
-Disappearing HUD/markers.
-Invisible anomalies.
-Random sound cutoffs.
-AI groups don't care where you are once you've angered them with your presence. They'll light you up very accurately through bushes, vehicles, stationary objects, and sometimes continue to track and shoot you even if you're behind solid objects like walls/fences. Most of the time you don't even have a direct line of sight. And yet they know exactly where you are... The mysterious mystery of the zone I guess.
-Weapons and equipment durability feels very weak. You pretty much have to visit technicians on regular basis to keep your stuff in good condition and avoid jamming at the worst time possible. AI doesn't seem to have that problem... Not to mention the amounts of rounds they send your way. With the latest update it ain't as expensive to visit the techs but still.
-[spoiler]No binoculars or NVG like in previous games.[/spoiler]
-[spoiler]Skif's motivation to stay in the zone is weak compared to the previous 3 games. If all Skif wanted to do was to make enough money to get another apartment/house, then why not farm some artifacts, sell them and get out?[/spoiler]

In conclusion. 
This game is alright and hopefully continues to get improved with patches/updates.
We'll have to wait and see what the future DLC will bring.
On a scale from 1 to 10, I'd say it's a 6 at this time.  
Hope this helps. Good luck and have fun.

"over 7 hours in and it really feels like a stalker game the atmosphere is definitely there BUT i really feel like it should run much better on my specs i have to use framegen to get smooth gameplay it's way to cpu limited i have an rtx 4090 ryzen 7 7800X3D and 32GB ram it really should be above 100fps at all times but they are stil improving the game constantly like the amount of patches and fixes are crazy really proves they care about their game unlike alot of other new big games lately but i think stil tho it's in a pretty good state but i really do hope for much better cpu optimisation frame gen should not be a must atleast not when you got specs like mine
 but the game is fucking huge i don't get how they where able to make this at the quality and fidelity they did i don't think i know another game with this level of detail that is this big i mean it has graphics of a story driven non open world game even the random npc's have insanely high detail !",positive
"What a fantastic game,
Playing it on a RTX2070, Performance was OK with settins mid to high. Rostock and the End have poor Performance, nut in general it runs good and I had no major bugs.
Story and gameplay are awsome and the open world is great.",positive
"As someone who got into stalker because of this game being announced and a friend being hyped I can truly say this game while not perfect, feels like the old games with a modern look and feel. Yes games being unfinished on release is not ideal in the slightest. Yes buggy piles of JANK are not something you should by at full price. However, the stalker games (at least the first 3) playing today are JANK. sure thats because of the age of them and comparability but the simple fact being if you enjoy it then you can justify the purchase. After about 35 hours I can really only play this game in a couple hour bursts and im enjoying it, just like I enjoyed the first 3 games even with their jank. I could not even finish clear sky because the final boss glitched through the floor and was unkillable under normal means. Did I have to use the developer tools to help get through parts of the game yes. As I have seen from the stalker fanbase who have been with these games for years they are ok with the jank because while this might be jank there is a lot of love poured into the game and I think that is obvious. Not to mention the situation for the developers being extraordinarily extreme the fact this came out at all is astounding. If you loved the original stalkers with their jank I think you will like this. If you are new to the series give it a bit. We already got more than 2 giant patches with some more to come. I really do enjoy the game and cannot wait for more.",positive
"enjoyable most of the time, i would wait until most of the bugs and issues with the game are addressed and the game goes on a sale.",positive
"I can't make up my mind about this damn game, I don't think I would have enjoyed it if I hadn't played the originals back in the day, but as an older S.T.A.L.K.E.R fan I loved the return to The Zone in 2. Just the gameplay felt kind of repetitive after a while and some of the boss fights and mutants felt overtuned. I'm playing on the hardest difficulty and have to say that at least the last fight is HORRIBLY FRUSTRATING.

The biggest thing I'd say is, if you haven'y played SoC and CoP play those first as they're cheaper. If you enjoy the worldbuilding of the older games, give this one a go.

Also you'll definitely enjoy this game a lot more if you've played the originals, as there is a lot of returning story concepts, characters, areas etc",positive
good game,positive
"Good about game...
*Graphics
*visual effects
*detailed and well made world and locations
*filled with decorations just amazing
*story
*side quests
*soundtrack
Bad about game...
-dont buy this game if you love original trilogy and played all great mods like autumn aurora,misery,ANOMALY EFP modpack and GAMMA...you will be dissapointed and mad
-alife is trash...even better say non existant everything will spawn in your vicinity..for me 90% of all time enemy/npc spawns from 50-70m with some very very rare exceptions...very immersion broken and annoying thing
-veteran diff is still way too easy..but thats personal for me...there is just too much ammo/meds/staff in world that you will  swim in coupons and items ofc if you know atleast abit what you do..see many ppl cry about economy are not sustainable..they are just trash players..try anomaly 1life hardcore or gamma..you will see what is hard and even those modes are easy sustainable after couple of hours in game
-ohhh those annoying aimbot human enemies....devs pls..there is way more options to make game hard and immersive same time..aimbotting is just lazy work...its not funny when you take breath line up head shot with you sniper rifle and get shot with boomstick from 100m when enemy runs towards you:)boomstick user should move towards me from cover to cover till he get at say 15m to use his weapon not just run straight line for 100m and just spam those laser acurate shots:)
-bullet eating sponges mutants...they are dumb and eats bullets its not have organisms works against bullets/shells..just look at anomaly mod..there enemy is way smarter deadly and dont eat bullets..there you get bullet types designed for doing dmg against flesh tissue..look for gromms ballistic mod for example..epic work!!!and there you can get meat from them and cook/sell parts in stalker 2 just avoid mutants they are useless
-and bugs bugs bugs bugs bugs bugs bugs atop of bugs...dint encounter game breaking for me...but alot of annoying trash,and patch 1.2.1 for me gets endless artefact flying bug..when you just reveal artefact it just fly in another direction before you can take it..and so you run around like chicken and try to get that stupid artefact...before latest patch didnt encounter this stupidness...
****Played trilogy stalkers countless hours before even got steam:)..played all great mods like autumn auror..misery...gamma and GOD MADE ANOMALY ESCAPE FROM PRIPYT modpack....and now stalker 2....most of all what i would gladly get is stalker anomaly mod with stalker 2 graphics...just graphics..rest anomaly now that would be my wet dream!!!
Soooo resume...better just look on youtube how good stalker 2 looks and please dont play it if you are stalker hardcore fan like me...i supported game devs as they deserved it in those hard times but pls fire your staff that is responsible for alife..combat and gameplay and give award for team responsible for graphics:)I know that atleast alife part most blame is to xbox because devs needed to make game to be able run at consoles,so imo devs should release seperate versions of game 1st release for xbox x/s and then work and make stalker 2 designed for pc where game can use more hardware power...like i remember that on cop misery mod if you got powerful pc you can unlock full map alife...i played with full alife and that was epic!!!Now im doomed...because i cant play stalker 2 at this state of game and cant go back to anomaly because its looking so bad compared to stalker 2:)so for me is only option...wait for anomaly team to move modpack on stalker 2 game and that can take years and im already old:)But still support devs in this hard time as modders will make epic things from stalker 2 in years!!!",negative

- Shooting sometimes gets boring because of bots ""see"" through the grass or bushes (but player dont, at least me)
- Some missions have ""overspawning"" on bots that creates fake pressure on player (for example amount of monoliths in last location or monsters on swamps etc). Some locations as well has fake ""one shot damagers"" to prevent player from exploring those area.
- Before A-Life gets fixed player had to carry TON of ammo to travel between locations. It still happens sometimes, but much less now.
- Pripyat' has controversial feeling of oppressiveness and corridors (some streets are just corridors that dictates limits for player, but hard to understand the real reason for that)

[h3]Positive:[/h3]
- I loved the exploration of the map, game always rewards curiosity (jumping around the building for an hours to find entry and loot the ""treasure"" inside). Nature is fantastic, landscapes are amazing, Zone lives its best life.
- Enjoyed variety of weapons, suits, artifacts.
- Story, side quests and cinematics are fascinating.
- A lot of stuff to do in Zone so easy to spend many-many hours in game.

I plan to play 2nd and 3rd time in year or so to retrieve and explore the map for real 100%.

enemies spawn in my buttholes 90% of the time and yes i have multiple holes from all the buttbutt stuff that has happened everytime u engage in battle, goofy ass spawns, highly forced spawns for story related shit, unoptimised world gens, less frames then the devs body count, 75% of the game is just walking maybe 10% looting, 5% side questing and 10% storyline, theres almost no reason to engage in combat, really unrewarding, fkin npcs will just let u walk by most of the missions, im there tap dancing infront of most mutants.
super repetitive gameplay, walk here to there talk to him or her walk back to there or whereever, kill a few magical spawning stuff and repeat.

"I have waited for this game for so long, and when it came out, it did not disappoint.
Yes, it has its problems, there are bugs, but which stalker game doesn't? It looks stunning, the shooting feels great, and the zone is absolutely massive.
It is being updated constantly, the devs are truly showing their love for their game.",positive
"S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 delivers an atmospheric and immersive world, yet falls short in several key gameplay aspects. While its environments and mechanics shine in some areas, others leave much to be desired.

World & Exploration:
The game’s world is undeniably one of its strongest elements. The environment is wonderfully crafted, featuring impressive weather effects, unique and detailed buildings, and an immersive sense of decay. However, it often feels empty, lacking life beyond hostile NPCs. The absence of female characters stands out, and the long walking distances without transportation options, such as a motorcycle, make exploration tedious. The stamina system is also overly punishing, depleting too quickly and adding unnecessary frustration.

Combat:
Combat in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 is a mixed bag. On one hand, weapons feel satisfying to use, delivering weighty and impactful gunplay. On the other hand, the AI is lackluster, with enemies exhibiting simplistic behavior while simultaneously being unfairly accurate sharpshooters. Weapon upgrades exist but feel underwhelming, failing to provide meaningful improvements.

Quests & Story:
The quest design is formulaic, largely boiling down to repetitive tasks: go there and retrieve an item, or go there and eliminate a target. The main story fails to engage, and side quests feel inconsequential, offering little incentive to complete them beyond basic rewards.

Survival Mechanics:
Despite branding itself as a survival game, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 lacks meaningful survival mechanics. The in-game economy is broken, with repair costs being excessively high. Hunger, thirst, and sleep mechanics exist but have little to no real impact, making them feel like an afterthought. Bleeding, however, is a well-implemented mechanic that adds a layer of tension. Unfortunately, the inventory weight limit is too restrictive, making looting and exploration frustrating.

Minigames & Anomalies:
One of the more enjoyable aspects is the artifact hunting system, which remains satisfying. Anomalies are well-designed, with some being truly unique and featuring interesting effects that add to the atmosphere and gameplay variety.

Performance & Bugs:
The game suffers from numerous bugs, including missing quest NPCs and occasional crashes. However, performance is generally strong, especially on high-end hardware like an RTX 4080, ensuring smooth gameplay when the game does function properly.

Conclusion:
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 offers a beautifully crafted yet flawed experience. Its world-building and atmosphere are top-notch, but its gameplay systems, AI, and quest design fail to reach the same heights. While there are enjoyable aspects, such as anomalies and artifact hunting, the game ultimately feels rough around the edges. If you’re a fan of the series or enjoy immersive open-world experiences, there is still something to appreciate—but expect frustrations along the way.

Because there are strong contenders in the open world survival genre, that do many of these points a lot better, I can't recommend this game in its current state. It ultimately even falls short to its own prequel. Check out the newly released Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 instead.",negative
Just wait for more fixes. Play old Stalker or Fallout 4 modded if you want a more complete less NOT non buggy game.,negative
"The gameplay loop would be much better if the traveling portion is made much easier and dont require you to sprint for hours. The story is rather confusing even after playing prev titles. I just cant recommend it to anyone. It`s like worse version of Metro Exodus with much bigger map.
It`s arguably worse than the prev titles overall. The combat is less sluggish, but the enemy felt dumber. The lack of A-life features makes the world a lot more static than it was. Go play Anomaly or Gamma if you want a relatively modern rendition of STALKER while retaining it`s core charm.",negative
"This game is still not good and it will take a year or two for this game to be good and playable
Just like most UE5 games, this is another massive trash, let's not even talk about the optimization this game has , there's nothing

Tbh, I believe the game will be good ONLY after GTA 6 will be released on PC

But as the saying goes, it is what it is
all we can do is wait 
and if you really wanna to play stalker 2? play stalker gamma

After a year, I will come back to the game and see how it is and make a new and better review.
But the damage is already done, a very BAD and SH*T release. 
Until then, this game will be on a long hiatus from me",negative
"I would love to love this game. Ive had fun for the majority of it. But the amount of bugs in the game is quite large. I am aware they are still working on it, but personally i think its unacceptable to have so many lighting issues and rendering issues. I play the game near maxed out and there are plenty of pop-ins. both objects and shader pop-in. not to mention sometimes npcs or enemies will be missing their bodies and just be floating heads. or sometimes bosses will just never spawn making some quests incompletable. only fix is to reload a previous save and hope it works that time. I am writing this review after dying in a fight because i pulled out my pistol and there was no gun in my hand. A common occurence in the zone apparently.",negative

Without dlss frame generation, it runs very badly, with full DLSS enabled it runs about 10% better, but looks like **** with ghosting and visual glitches, flickering on every step. Don't make my mistake and don't support developers releasing games in this state. This is absolutely horrible.",negative

"It's not as good as the original, but nearly so. I got really sick of sprinting across the empty map that is way too big. There are too many resources so you won't really struggle, but you'll definitely do some fetch quests where you just boring sprint across the entire map only to do it again and again.",positive
I do enjoy this game but got to a point where i had to make a decision and I felt like no decision was a good option. 6.5/10. huge fan of the originals,positive

"Very raw project, not recommended in its current state.

cons:

* shit side quests
* enemies appear behind your back in majority amount of fights

pros:

Several major updates and the game STILL has severe performance issues.,negative
They fixed the bugs by adding more bugs,positive
"The game is good, the core gameplay is fun, and it's a solid shooter. It's also fairly unique as a shooter in that it offers a non-linear story. Exploration is really cool, even if the loot you find is garbage. It often involves solving some small puzzle to get to the stash, which is rewarding in a nice way. The game needed some updates but I think after 1.2 it's in good shape. However, it is clear that there is plenty of unfulfilled potential here.

There is a huge number of artifacts in the game but most of them are irrelevant, and not really tied to the story or even any non-generic side quests. Maybe the original idea with less favorable economy was that you were supposed to sell them to finance your gear? Otherwise, the vast majority of them are useless and you'd never ""wear"" them.

The ammo types bring some interesting variations, but some weapons have a ""Flat"" ammo type, which is again completely irrelevant as combat only really happens at short ranges due to some limitations. AP and Expansive ammo, however, do have meaningful gameplay impact.

Graphically the game is not pretty enough (especially if you consider how ugly buildings can look from just 150m away) to justify the performance.

From a different perspective, it's a miracle this even came out. I would definitely recommend playing, but maybe it's not worth spending 160 hours.",positive
"thanks to the most recent updates, crashes are no longer a problem, the game is exciting and enjoyable, graphics are good if you have a good GPU, im running a 2060 super and the graphics are mid at best if you want 60-90 fps, unreal engine 5 is new and primitive as advanced as they claim it to be so dont expect much with anything less than a 30 series,  the original stalker feel in a new game, plenty of mutants and bandits to fight, stashes to loot, side quests to explore and relics to uncover, the primary mission give about 60 hours of gameplay, im about 2/3 of the way through the game and i definatley reccomend this game if you want an open world shooter looter like fallout, this has great story and characters to like love and hate, factions to side with and rare stalker guns and their upgrades to uncover in special stash locations hinted by PDAs and local information, overall id give this game a nice 8.5/10, pick it up on sale if your skeptical but the game has alot to do",positive
"Not fun, most of the early game ive seen is nearly pitch black. Enemies basicly invisible or kill you when you can barely see 1 pixel of them all while stealth not working for the player. I admit i havent seen much, franticly side hopping or cheesing mutant enemies is horrible gameplay.
WTF is the point?
",negative
"I'm currently playing on veteran mode and whenever I run into a goddamn bloodsucker, I end up wasting all my resources to try and kill the mutant. There needs to be a rework for the enemy's because this is getting ridiculous, sometimes I get softlocked because whenever I run out of resources I have to die and reset all the progress i made into killing the damn thing. I eventually have to just reduce the difficulty to rookie to kill them, even then, the damn things still take about 3 shotgun blasts to kill. So yeah, they need to do something about the enemy's.",negative

"Hello Stalkers, 

after almost 60hrs, I'can say that I really enjoy this post-apo game. Environment are so lively and I can feel de challenge of those gun fight and monsters encounters. If you like fallout game or Metro game, I really think this game is for you. The first half of the game is pretty challenging but you need to gain enought skills for what is coming.

I have to say there is some bugs and overpower monsters, it a bit annoying but fine. Bug fix and update will be nessesary but since the last big update it make the game even better !

Stay sharp and good luck in the Zone stalkers !",positive
"Long awaited and definitely not disappointed. The beginning may have seemed slow, there were a couple of crashes, but updates and patches fixed everything.

Awesome game!,positive
"One thing I would like to address is the reviews of other. there are ALOT of negative reviews on this game and they almost all come from one of 2 things. Either someone encountered a game breaking bug and got upset then made a negative review (which is understandable) however with the 1.2 update a vast majority of game breaking bugs have been fixed and that gets rid of almost all the negative reviews the game has. without those this would be rated at 90% plus for those that care. the second thing you will see in negative reviews comes down the the A.I. of the world not being as good as it was in the originals. this is a true point even after the 1.2 update. however it is completely blown out of proportion by the old school die hard fans. yes it is not as life like as it was in the older games but the game is also working with alot more and it is something that has already been improved and will continue to improve because the devs truely care about the game. As it stand right now after the 1.2 update the A.I. is still better then almost any AAA title i can think of in recent memory. its still better then even current cyberpunk 2077 and people are eating that shit up so for everyone that isnt a salty die hard fan of the originals the A.I. is currently more than good enough to really enjoy the game and to keep you immersed. Before this goes on for to long ill keep my personal review a little shorter. The world is almost perfect in both looks and design there is not going to be a single moment while playing the game that you dont want to explore. you see a building or a truck or anything out and about you want to go look at it and its because they do loot and rewards for exploration better than any game ever made. I find myself constantly thinking hey that would be a really cool place to have some loot! and not just in Stalker i mean in any loot game. that is a thought that comes across your mind often. however in Stalker 2 THE LOOT IS ACTUALLY THERE. I cant tell you how many times ive gone to the top of buildings or back of caves in games and there was just literally nothing there other than a waste of time. But not in stalker 2 no, if you see a cool spot there is probably loot there if you see a locked door there is some cool way to open it some neat puzzle that actually makes sense. and this exploration is just inhanced so much by the random events and the dangers of the anomolies and other enemies. so world and exploration are 10/10. now gameplay is a little different but still almost perfect. there are some issues with weapon balancing that dont really make sense and you will run into the issue of having way to much food and meds even on veteran which does end up with you dropping oblivion style loot splurges of meds and food items. like one time i had 70 med kits on me and i just dropped almost all of them. so the way that loot is distributed is a bit off and it ends up interupting gameplay in a negative way. depending on your personal skill with the game ammo can have the same problem where you just have so much it dont even matter anymore. like im only 30 hours in on my vet playthrough and i have 3 stacks of 900 rounds of multiple ammo types (not the alt ammos just the base) I understand that i have a slower loot everything playstyle but tldr there is to much loot and i feel like it takes away from the survival aspect of gameplay. as for the rest of the gameplay it plays very well the guns feel great everything feels quick and responsive the only thing missing is some balance on the guns because damage drop of from distance and armor pen stats on alot of the guns dont make sense. like sadly if you want to be just objective about it snipers are basically useless as are AR's when compared to some of the other weapons (as a quick side note this is only when you are trying to just use the objectivly best things) Durring a casual playthrough though if your not interested in min maxing and just enjoying the game I will say that even though the gun balance needs some work and some stuff dont make sense EVERY weapon is viable on any difficulty they will all get the job done so it really isnt something that is going to negativly effect your gameplay. so gameplay right now is a solid 8.5/10. the current over all player experiance is a solid 9/10 and I only see it getting better much much better.",positive
"Very good, I like this a lot!

Sure it's buggy and janky, but I believe this is a good open world RPG experience.",positive
really fun,positive
"Patch 1.2, nice now it's a cool game",positive
"I really enjoyed this game a hell of a lot, its been a while since i got immersed in a big story driven game. 
I didn't feel like i wanted to rush through the story, i actually wanted to explore the map and look in all the locations for loot, stashes and secrets. Most open world games are just open world for the sake of it and feel like copy and paste rush jobs, but in this game you can tell every bit of the map has been carefully and purposely created, which makes a hell of a difference. The environment feels atmospheric and full, never making it feel dull and boring. 

The combat feels satisfying and punchy, the gun sounds sound amazing and they feel good to shoot. my only gripe with the combat is the NPC's feel very aimbotty at times, like every bullet hits and its damn near impossible to escape. If you get caught out in the open to a gang, its a garantee death. It's good to see different factions having battles in the distance and hunting mutants, gives the game more atmopshere...

My favourite part of the game is the immersion and story, it has a very deep story and lore that kept me gripped the whole time, not knowing which was the story was going. The only downside to the game apart from the bugs was the scripted scenarios which were triggered at certain parts of the game, not being obvious on what to do... becoming very frustrated in fighting certain mutants instead of following a certain path the game wanted you to follow. The set emission scenarios were frustrating at first thinking you only had to be inside somewhere, going into a bunker thinking i was safe only to be killed for some reason. The games wants you to run to a certain building thats been marked on the map instead, not being able to make it sometimes and reverting back a couple of saves.

Game is very close to being a 9/10
Did enjoy alot apart a couple of annoying scenarios, will play again for alternative endings for sure!",positive
"Somehow getting less playable with each patch.  It wasn't great to start with, but it was ok.  I took a break (you'll probably need to as well, it goes on forever and there's SO MUCH WALKING without fast travel or enemies) but when I came back a month or two later it looked and played significantly worse than it had after release.  I feel pot committed to finish at this point 70 hours in because i""m finally approaching the end game (hopefully).  This game needed to be cut down by about a third, you're just going back and forth back and forth on this huge map that can take 20 minutes at times to get back where you just were.  20 minutes of not just pointing yourself in a direction and holding a key down (I wish) but also trying to get around large sections of needless lakes, rivers, ravines and cliff walls you have to walk forever to get around.  If ever a game needed fast travel it was this one.   Every quest given you're like, ""Ï was JUST THERE, he told me to come talk to YOU, how do yáll not have radios? OH WAIT YOU DO."" So back you go walking the other direction again, until you have to go north for 10 minutes because of a river that only has one bridge and it's way the freak up there out of your way, and if you're lucky you'll see a mutant rat to shoot maybe, but don't get your hopes up.  Another annoying thing is it feels like it's constantly nighttime, and my guess it's a cop out to ease the graphics load.  Get ready for a game that has you running around in the dark with a headlamp a LOT.  Its not bad because it's not as good as the previous games in the series, it's bad because it's just a poor video game.",negative
Walking simulator but its actually fun,positive
"I honestly don’t understand how this game even made it to market. It’s enjoyable when it works, but the key word here is when. When there are no NPCs or enemies, I can consistently hit 90+ FPS. However, as soon as more than three NPCs spawn, the game turns into a slideshow, and the performance becomes unbearable. I either have to restart the game or reload it to restore a playable state. The performance is horrendous, and even after patch 1.2, it’s still unplayable. The only thing that’s enjoyable in the current state is exploration—but even then, it's a dice roll whether I can explore with 90 FPS or 5 FPS. It's honestly an achievement that I’ve made it this far without dropping the game",negative
"I experienced very limited bugs, and have found the AI spawning to be improved. 
The world is gritty and dark and engaging, you can make choices in the story. 
Some small frame drops at times, but I am not playing on a very high end PC. 

I can only imagine the possibilities will continue to improve as modding because more accessible/possible.",positive
"Funny, patch after patch this game is getting worse in terms of overall performance. At the beginning I haven't had any issues while playing on epic graphic settings, getting 100-120 fps', but now it somehow looks worse, plays worse, stutters and I think I have enough of that at this point of time.

Currently S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 is pretty much perfect, aside from being Extremely Demanding on PC hardware for Max Graphics gaming. And some lack of weapons in the game.

It's pretty much perfect.

Characters are boring and always have some fetch/favor quest.

The combat is slow and you do little to no damage, also enemy AI is like playing against someone with an aimbot.

You die from EVERYTHING in this game.  There's these invisible bullshit things that you have to throw like a nut at to get it to move for no reason.

The inventory system is clunky too.

Modders have tried to make this game better, and they have, but it's just not enough, and each patch breaks most mods.  It's almost to the point where you have to run a mod just to make it palatable.

"Got struck by a bug 15 hours in, and now I can't continue my playthrough. My HUD disappeared and won't come back. I tried:
- Restart game
- Reload save
- Turn off the HUD from the settings then turn it back on
- Verify integrity of game files
- Reinstalled game

Apparently this glitch has been a menace since the game launched and it still isn't fixed, based on forum posts I've read.

I was really enjoying it until then, really hope a fix is pushed out so I can continue my game soon.

UPDATE: Solved by going back about 5 saves, so that's about an hour of progress lost, but I was able to continue

UPDATE: Stopped by another bug. This time, it's the emissions.... sometimes an emission will happen and you'll be expected to take shelter in a specific building nearby. The problem is that sometimes the building is off limits due to story line related reasons. This bug has struck me twice now and on both occasions, the solution was to lose ~30 minutes of progress by going back a few saves.",negative

"The atmosphere thins in the latter parts of the game.
In the end it completely turns into story shooter that just ships you between story points.
This can be forgiven since the story is good - the end feels rushed though.
It feels as though you are ripped out of the endgame way too early.

The beginning is very good though.
It hits the atmosphere and promises to be the worthy contender for the series.
However the game quickly loses polish. Especially once the midpoint is hit the game fails to add the interesting atmosphere the other games had. You stop feeling like a loner in the zone instead you are someone else.
Along with this midpoint side quests become scarce and less interesting.
Eventually it feels like you are just walking from mission to mission - often doing very little before walking again. Rinse repeat. This is exacerbated by the long lack of quick travel.

That being said the anomalies are once again amazing. I took my time just walking around to find amazing places - a giant tornado, a creepy cabin in the woods. The visual atmosphere is spot on and these are truly wonders sometimes that draw me in like a magnet. However the story doesn't lead you there - sometimes there are interesting side quests, in face most were interesting.

However due to the frequent bugs I realized eventually that my run won't work out without cheating since the bugs amassed where I couldn't upgrade the weapons I was using.

That being said a lot of the bugs I had are being actively fixed so they might not affect you. Overall it's a decent game that got so overly ambitious that it messed up its latter parts. I believe that eventually the devs will be able to fix the most glaring flaws. It's a worthwhile game - if you love the story.",positive
Fantastic game. Looking forward to see what the modding community will do!,positive

"Yea sure, game could be way better. But it still is awesome Stalker. Graphics are insane especially weather. Im playing on hard difficulty and enemies are not that sponge as some people say. Usually 1 headshot kills them. Some mutants can take more but hey they are supposed to. Shotgun still clears most of them quite good. Game runs smooth on my 4080, I had only fps drop during first ""boss fight"". Only little dissapointment is that stalker stashes you find usually hold some kind of generic loot that is not really worth your time. Little ammo, vodka and piece of bread. And you make crazy acrobatics around anomalies to get that. Oh and the lack of night vision is crap. Beside of that its pretty nice. Love how environment was built. AI may not be best but mutants actually hides from you when you get on some kind of roof, not going off easily.",positive
So there are alot of things to like in this game. i get the scarcity of ammo and health stuff even though the world apparently really wants the stuff there so there really would in theory be alot of ammo and supplies when the stuff is so valuable. My biggest complaint is the fact there is no reason to fight the mutants. There isn't even a bounty system. You would think that in towns there would be a local government office or some crap that would pay for proof of dead mutants. They are annoying and just make you use up ammo that is way too precious to use up on something that vast majority of the time gives you nothing. There is no reward for the struggle. Would really like them to change that.,negative
"A Return to the Zone – An Unforgiving, Buggy, Yet Beautiful Journey
97 hours. That’s how long it took me to crawl, fight, and survive through the Zone in STALKER 2—and what a ride it was.

What I Loved:
✅ Back in the Zone – Nothing beats returning to the Zone, grabbing a sausage and some bread, and kicking some miserable bandit ass. The atmosphere is on point.
✅ Satisfying Firepower – Accidentally stumbled upon the GAUSS rifle right when I needed it the most. Exploring everywhere was worth it.
✅ Absolutely Gorgeous – Even though I couldn't max out settings due to my GTX 1080 Ti and Ryzen 7 1800X, the game is still visually stunning.
✅ CIRCAA is Incredible – This place quickly became my favorite location. Well-designed, *immersive, but… why can’t we buy artifacts there?
✅ The Difficulty – Brutally hard. Some sections I had to redo over and over, and yet… I liked the pain. Maybe I’m a masochist.
✅ Anxiety Through the Roof – Every decision made me paranoid. ""What if I chose wrong? What happens next?"" The tension was real.

What Frustrated Me:
❌ Performance Struggles – With my hardware, I barely got 40 FPS on average. It’s playable, but not great.
❌ Bugs… Lots of Bugs – Story progression bugs forced me to search online for fixes. Characters vanished during cinematics. FPS drops, weird glitches—you name it. Hoping future updates will fix these.
❌ The Ending… – After everything I went through, the conclusion felt like a revolution in circles. Just another day in the Zone, and back to square one. If this is the last STALKER, fine—I don’t need another one.
❌ QoL Issues – No way to rename save files like in the classic games, making it frustrating when I needed to reload specific points.
❌ Artifacts & Coupons – Ended up selling most of my artifacts because I had no coupons left. Never found one with full endurance, and most felt useless.
❌ Economy Feels Harsh – Spent a lot on repairs and upgrades. The grind is real.
❌ Weight Limits & Stamina – Carrying capacity felt too restrictive. More Hercules pills would’ve been nice. At least all those energy drinks didn’t kill me… yet.
❌ No Vehicles?! – The Zone is massive, yet no transportation? Really?
❌ Bayuns, Rat Swarms, and Weird Feelings – Personal taste, but I HATE those mutant cats. Also, the game’s overall feel and tuning are just… off compared to previous STALKERs.

Final Verdict:
Despite all its flaws, STALKER 2 is a gem—a rough, unforgiving, bug-ridden, anxiety-inducing masterpiece. I don’t regret playing it, but I do hope future patches improve the experience.
⭐ 7.5/10 – Survive at Your Own Risk ⭐",positive
"BUGS - Lots of bugs - lost two sets of save games.  They are in the files but game doesn't recognise them.
Given up on this game - too frustrating to play.",negative
hmm..Guess I need to wait for next update to finish the game,negative
Enjoyable fresh out of the box but mods take it up a notch. A great looter shooter title with an OK story line.,positive

"at launch this game ran fine for me, but now everything in the distance is pixelated. ive tried multiple fixes on reddit but nothing works.",negative
"Performance still bad, nothing changed",negative
"It's been a while since I played a game so impressive in some aspects, while also being so annoying in the others. There are many things I like, mainly the fact that the game is  simply beautiful, some of the views are mesmerizing and you can really tell that it  must have taken years to make the Zone look like this. The gunplay, while not without its' problems is fun in general, the weapons are well-modeled and animated and they have ""the punch"".  
The story is compelling and the main characters are interesting, but the game is simply too long. Especially the last main missions after arriving to Prypyat seem to drag on forever. The story just doesn't know when to end. The endings are satisfing though and you have the feeling that your choices matter.
Unfortunately, the game, even after the patches is still filled with problems. It is less buggy than on the launch but you can encounter bugs which can stop the quests progress, The AI is downright cheating, they can land a clean headshot, in the nighttime, with the MP5 from around 200 meters and their granades always land by your feet, no matter what. Not to mention, the enemies, especially later in the game are the walking bullet-sponges. Lastly, some of the boss fights really could use the redesign. 
Nevertless, despite the complains, the game was worth the wait and I really respect the devs for releasing it, concerning the circumstances. If you liked the previous Stalker games or simply want to play an FPS with a captivating story and don't mind the slower-paced gameplay, you should definetely try it out.",positive
"Massive disappointment. The only positive thing I can say about this game is that they got the vibe of the zone right. Everything else, from fundamental gameplay systems like spawning and damage values, to more on-the-surface things like visual clarity and mission content, are either unpolished, unfinished, or broken. This game completely lacks almost everything that made the earlier titles fun. 
I sincerely hope that sometime down the line, they fix this game and I can change this review to a more positive one. Based on the fact that they're currently lying about a-life being ""in the game"" but just buggy, I don't have high hopes that that'll happen, but I hope to be proven wrong.",negative
"Every time this game gets an ""Update"" it downloads the full 125 Gigabytes. Every time.",negative
"75+ hours and still halfway through the game, so much to discover.
This game is on-par with the Metro franchise and Witcher 3 .. by the time the DLCs are released the game will be refined further this will be a combination of dying light 1, the whole metro series, witcher 3 and fallout all in one. what a glorious game. This game was made for real gamers. 

Speaking of refinement -  it's so painful reading the negative reviews, predictably spewed from the 2000's born generation and younger - the soft spoiled gens.

There is literally a term in game development called ""post-launch patch window"" or ""post-launch support"". all major games like cyberpunk, witcher 3, fallout, etc.. had major bugs at launch, predictable as its a test period for the masses with different hardware and platforms. stalker 2 developers had to work through covid restrictions, and had to move over 180 families from literal warzones in ukraine and still got the game done, with most bugs patched within 3 months of release as recent as last week from the date I wrote this review.

if you can't stand the inevitable 100% guarantee in bugs at launch, dont buy new major game releases within the first 3-6 months. and getgud you insufferable spoiled generation.",positive
"game is an incomplete dumpster fire that's un-optimized and doesn't even look good, so many glitches and things that should've been fixed before it was released. 

Just another game following the trend of releasing an incomplete product then slowly ""fixing"" what should've been fixed before the game was released.

IF the game was as it should be, then it'd be 7/10 or 8/10
as the game is now (post patch 1.2) 5/10. fix this trash.

"a bit of a slog and frustrating at times, but i feel it ties into the world building tbh. the zone in an unforgiving place and its going to piss you off at times, just kinda the nature of the eurojank game. def was a very enjoyable experience for the most part. i would not rank this above SOC (its still the best one i feel) but it is absolutely worth your time and energy. I have not been this immersed in a game world before. pick this game up in a year and give the devs a little more time to polish things up a bit, and i believe after that the game will be where they want it to be.

built a whole new computer for this game was def worth the investment

[spoiler] i dont understand why people are complaining about the game being hard if you don't side with the ward. they are a well armed government military group and you are a rag tag bunch of Europeans eating canned meat shooting at them with guns covered in mud. of course its going to be difficult!

"Yo dude wtf

Can't even play, has a really bad memory leak 1-2 minutes into loading.  Fix the game.  Sold my kidney for a GPU and can't even play the game I bought it for",negative
"UNPLAYABLE until they fix the performance issues. 

The beauty and tactical gameplay means nothing if my 3070 and i7-10700k can barely scrape together 30 frames when I'm in heavy combat. THAT'S WITH DLSS AND FRAMEGEN ON. Not to mention how horribly discongruent it is to have to play a tactical shooter with that kind of input lag. Not to mention how ugly and blurry DLSS can be when framerates are struggling.

I REALLY WANTED TO ENJOY THIS. In fact I did for a bit, but it got old extremely fast having every single gunfight end up in a slideshow. DO NOT BUY THIS until the game is complete with patches and/or community mods to fix performance. 

This is seriously the only game my PC has ever had UNPLAYABLE framerates with. It just makes no sense at all when I can play Battlefield, Cyberpunk, modded BGS games, Ghost of Tsushima, etc with 100+ FPS. 

I refuse to be gaslit into thinking I need to upgrade lol.",negative
"The game requires a lot of work. It's C-tier gameplay, unfortunately , and a step backward in all areas except graphics compared to previous titles in the series. While I continue to play it each patch, I would not recommend it to new players, especially at full price.",negative
"I stopped playing a while ago to give the devs time to polish the game, It isn't my favorite Stalker game as there is too much missing here that was available in the original 3 games.
While I understand that they had to make it under extraordinary circumstances that I hope I never have to experience for myself I think they should have delayed it for at least 6 months to give themselves a chance to release a more feature complete game.
Having said this, I can still recommend playing it because I am having fun, the bones of a good game are here.
I made it to a pivotal quest where the game became more interesting and added harder gameplay ( no spoilers ) and look forward to coming back and finishing the game.",positive
"Unbelievable I can't even start the game now, due to the abominable yet unsolvable ""shader warmup failed"" nonsense. I've been too kind on this game and its numerous issues -performance to crashes to A-life issues- and now I can't even start the damn thing. I'm done.",negative

"Shallow game that's all visuals. No AI life, bad performance (looks like modded fallout 4), bad plot progression. Just play the previous games and the overhaul mods.",negative
"The graphics are good but that is where it ends. The player spends an enormous amount of time moving from one map location to another. After a while it gets boring.
Enemies appear out of thin air. In one battle, I stood still and watched enemies continuously appear out of thin air while I unloaded my shotgun on them. No fun.
The boss fights are just plain silly. 
The plot is confusing.

And I haven't talked about all of the glitches.

I do not recommend this game right now it just a buggy mess. I have so many memory leaks and missions do get glitch and stuck so have to download a command mod just to fix it.

Game has so many bugs it ruins the play through. Seems like they rushed to get the game out and half assed it. The latest update broke the audio so i have no sound in game.  Headphones work in other apps & games. Waste of money buying this game as it looked like a great game.,negative

Probably after some patches it will be better. But now now...",negative
"The game has the foundation to be a really solid game in the long term, but currently the game needs a solid year of continued development to polish the game and address a number of game breaking bugs.

"Атмосферно, но излишне аномально.

Несмотря на все баги, вылеты, боссфайты с 10 FPS, баганые квесты, глупый ИИ врагов, сырой A-Life, компиляцию шейдеров по 5 минут при каждом заходе в игру, несбалансированную сложность с тонной ХП у псевдогигантов и химер, душные локации вроде Болот, довольно проходной сюжет с персонажами, которые вряд ли запомнятся, однообразные диалоги и квесты, средненькие анимации лиц — познакомиться с серией S.T.A.L.K.E.R. было интересно.

Не помню, когда в последний раз залипал в игру по 4–5 часов и не замечал, как летит время. Хоть ты и тратишь кучу времени, просто переходя из точки А в точку B, но именно эти передвижения погружают тебя в суровый мир. Ты экономишь ресурсы (поначалу), продумываешь маршрут, ищешь обходные пути. В этом и есть суть игры.

Лутать артефакты и обходить аномалии — уникальная и весьма занимательная механика, которой нет больше ни в одной игре. Хотя баффы артефактов могли бы быть интереснее: например, добавили бы бонус к урону, шанс крита или скорость бега. Да, местами кажется, что разработчики перестарались с хардкорностью — если у тебя хотя бы жёлтый перегруз, то персонаж устаёт очень быстро: два-три удара ножом или пару прыжков — и всё, энергия на нуле. Это явно требует лучшего баланса. Так же не хватает какой-то прокачки персонажу и больше возможностей прокачки оружия, например увеличение дамага или тот же критический урон.

Почти все купоны ты тратишь на починку брони и оружия, что тоже не очень. Хорошо хоть, что артефакты не нужно заряжать заново за деньги. Я бы сделал ремонт дешевле процентов на 25 — и было бы в самый раз.

Сюжет в целом не зацепил, хотя я пытался разобраться. Концовки выглядят реалистично, учитывая стиль повествования, но мне кажется, что я вышел на самую логичную и каноничную — за Стрелка. Особенно заинтересовался сюжетом во время квеста в НИИЧАЗе: когда ты на контрасте попадаешь в киберпанк-комплекс после Зоны — это просто невероятно. Сцены драк тоже сделаны хорошо, но их маловато. Дополнительные квесты есть шикарные — например, «Маковое поле» или «Три капитана». Но есть и масса однообразных, особенно у торговцев.

Музыка и саунд-дизайн великолепны: эмбиент во время прогулок по Зоне отлично погружает в атмосферу. Звуки стрельбы шикарные, взрывы гранат, оглушения, заклинивание оружия — всё это сделано очень круто. Контролёр, который выбивает оружие из рук, заставляет бомбить, но ты понимаешь, что это уникальная механика — за это респект. Так же бомбит от заклинивания оружия, но потом осознаёшь, что это вполне реалистично и, сквозь слёзы, признаёшь — да, всё-таки это прикольно.

Атмосфера — главная фишка этой игры. Диалоги сталкеров у костра, моменты, когда ты пережидаешь Выброс в укрытии с другими сталкерами или просто идёшь с полным хабаром к торговцу, а по дороге встречаешь незнакомцев, которым нужна помощь — всё это делает игру дико антуражно. Узнаваемые орнаменты, отсылки к украинским писателям, реальные здания из Припяти и постройки, похожие на те, что я видел на своей родине — всё это работает на меня. Ну и NON STOP разработчики прорекламировали знатно :).

В общем, за 100 часов игры и с надеждой на апдейты ставлю:

Remember in 2007 when Shadow of Chernobyl came out and no one was able to run it smoothly? Well the same case is here also.

This game not only gives the same atmosphere, but also the same experience of issues we had in the original, lol.
So, be patient, tweak the graphics, try to get the best settings until it is playable enough because it is worth it.

In terms of gameplay experience, comparing the original STALKER games WITH MODS to STALKER 2 would be unfair. These mods were not made by the developers at GSC. 

Compare vanilla trilogy to STALKER 2 and you will see how good of a game it is.

As long as you go into it knowing that, and take reasonable precautions (i.e. a hard save every hour or so) then the bugs are not as bad as everybody makes out.

"It's ok. Not a patch on stalker complete. My RTX 4090 struggles to get a steady 60 fps in 4k. I have to use DLSS and frame gen which gives me constant screen tearing, Just DLSS on its own doesn't hold a steady 60fps either so it breaks the immersion, Seams like it needs a few mods to get it running properly. I might uninstall it and leave it for a while. I feel annoyed with myself for paying so much for an unfinished game. And if this is it and it is actually finished, I will leave it for my next upgrade in about 5 years. It simply isn't smooth enough. I have so many other games that actually run well that I could be playing. Huge disappointment.

Edit: It seems that using frame gen and setting vsync in control panel to on is more smooth. 

I will probably change my review to positive after a couple more patches",negative
STALKER 2 feels like an apocalyptic Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 and I am absolutely immersed in it.,positive
"I played my first Stalker game around 2010 and I’ve loved the gameplay loop ever since. Deadly mutants, lethal human factions, and a post Chernobyl disaster map. Stalker 2 delivers more of the same with an expanded map, better graphics, and just more of the same gameplay that I like to play. I will say the in-game economy is rough until you get about half way through the game. The more you upgrade your gear, the more it costs to repair. I would recommend prioritizing durability upgrades and piercing upgrades to keep repair costs low. By the time the final mission rolled around, I had hundreds of thousands of koupons to buy upgrades for my exosuit. Enemies are lethal and don’t miss. With this being said, you don’t have to fight every mob. I found most fights that occurred in an open area I lost due to the nature of the AI and their incredible aim. Fighting the AI indoors or areas where there’s cover is completely doable. 

As of this review, I played about 75 hours on patch 1.1.3 and unlocked one of the endings, Korshunov’s ending. The major bugs I encountered were the shader compilation bug, some odd texture bugs here and there, and the game crashed once. These bugs have been supposedly fixed. Performance could be better, but the game is on UE5 and my PC is getting a little tired these days so that’s more of a me problem. 

Overall, I loved the game and I’m excited for the expansions. I’ll probably replay the story again as more A-Life improvements roll out.

"Compiling shaders, please wait...",negative
"I've probably downloaded close to 1TB of this game, be it reinstalling, or enormously large updates, and I've only been able to irk out close to 8 hours of gameplay because of technical issues.

Very disappointing, if you're reading this, buy the game on A. a very deep sale, or b. when the Gamma mod team releases their stuff.",negative
"Awesome game! If you liked the previous titles, you're gonna enjoy this. If you liked the stand alone mod ANOMALY, you're gonna like this. Sure it's got it's share of flaws, but so did the previous titles which was half the charm. Now I'm not saying it's an unplayable mess, far from it, but it does have some bugs, but then again, which new games doesn't have some bugs before the patches start rolling in from the developers. All that said, Stalker 2 is an amazing game with some beautiful graphics, great setting, great atmosphere and fun gameplay.",positive
"As a fan of post-apocalyptic settings and open-world exploration, STALKER 2 delivers an immersive experience that truly captures the eerie, desolate beauty of the Zone. The atmosphere is top-notch, with hauntingly detailed environments, unpredictable AI encounters, and a gripping sense of survival that keeps you on edge. The world feels alive, dangerous, and rewarding for those who love to venture off the beaten path.

However, the game is not without its flaws. While the exploration and storytelling shine, technical issues frequently disrupt the experience. Bugs, crashes, and AI glitches can break immersion, making it frustrating at times. It's disappointing because the core gameplay is excellent, but these technical problems hold it back from reaching its full potential.

If you're a fan of the STALKER series or love atmospheric, exploration-heavy games, STALKER 2 is still worth playing. Just be prepared for some rough edges that may require patience (or future patches) to fully enjoy.",positive
"Don't listen to the whining haters. This game is SUPERB. Just visually, and for the exploration side, it's a real treat. Anybody with the least bit of taste for urbex should absolutely play it ; haven't had that kind of vibe since INFRA. The systems are fine, the world is nicely handcrafted, the sound design is gorgeous. Honestly, YES. They did it. Kudos.",positive
"I have tried about 6 times to enjoy this game and besides making the game look like absolute garbage and finding several fixes for quests because they break so often I cannot for the life of me get this game to actually run correctly. I understand the stigma of AMD cards as well but I have an RX 7900 XT 20GB GDDR6 and a Ryzen 7 5700X3D chip with 32gbs ddr4 3600mhz ram and the game cant even achieve medium settings at 1080p. I have to lower the settings to their absolute lowest and even then I can barley achieve 60 fps. Performance issues aside the game also breaks and crashes more than gods drunkest driver, they never should have moved to UE5. I'd comment on the story but honestly I cant even get passed have the missions due to the fact they usually break. Overall maybe in like another year or two the game will be fixed, otherwise dont play this the old Stalker games are still great and at least you can get a stable frame rate in those games. Just a very disappointing video game.",negative

"DO NOT BUY. Soulless buggy mess.

I really tried to give it a try because some of the good reviews have a lot of hours but its just impossible.

- Takes 2-20 times to walk into the same anomaly to get the artifact to spawn.
- Enemies not spawned in an enemy base just to spawn behind you after you walk for 2m.
- Have to google everything due poor explanations, and the multitude of bugs preventing you from proceeding even if you are doing everything correctly.
- Stash box not spawning even while having the stash marker. (I googled the exact location, and saw a literal screenshot of it being there)
- UI randomly disappearing. (Need to go into settings to turn it off and on to make it work again)
- Everything feels scripted. (nothing wrong with scripting events, the issue is that they're so overly obvious it destroys any hope for immersion)
- The dialog boxes sometimes disappear making me miss out on context. (I played with Ukrainian voice lines for better immersion)
- Enemies endlessly respawning. After killing 30, and running out of ammo I just gave up. (Why even add unlooted body markers if the intention is to have the player run away instead of looting kills?)
- Also, personal opinion but the UI is ugly, graphics look way better on their older games when modded, and the characters look like dolls instead of actual people.",negative
Stalker 2 try to be better than 20 year old game challenge not possible,negative
"very good FPS RPG, would recommend having at least a 4060. like bare minimum",positive
"   The game itself is amazing. The story, atmosphere, and gameplay are fantastic. But…
The technical part is absolute garbage.
 - There are so many bugs, glitches, and unfinished elements that I just want to tell the developers they are clumsy clowns. It really feels like they neglected the second half of the game, especially the ending.
 - In the later locations, textures disappear, the interface and weapons vanish, and the frame rate drops significantly. My game kept freezing at the main base in the Rostok location—in the exact same spot every time!
 - Enemies spawn out of thin air right behind you. They shoot through walls and obstacles, while you can’t even see them.
So, despite my love for STALKER, I cannot give this shit a positive rating, purely because of its atrocious technical execution and optimization. This ruins everything.
By the time I reached the ending, I just ran forward to finish it as quickly as possible.",negative
cool game,positive
"Honestly, this could be a decent game, with a unique premise building on a solid historical storyline.
But it's just so hard to get over the bugs and poorly optimised performance.
Literally every patch has both fixed and introduced bugs that directly impact gameplay.
Even now, the latest patch has introduced a bug preventing you progressing through the main story arc.

Pretty hard to recommend a game with such poor quality control.
Bit of a shame really, had such potential.",negative
"This game reeeeeally scratches my pack rat itch. Scavenging is fun, and the combat is challenging without being too frustrating. It has some bugs and odd design choices, but I can't fault it for that. The core experience is what keeps me coming back.",positive

"Steam has a limit in review lenght, so I put p.2-6 in the comments

[h1] General impression [/h1]

185 hours. Veteran difficulty.

First, most ""comprehensive"" walkthrough - completed. I set myself the goal of ""digesting"" as much content as possible from the first playthrough, and it seems that I achieved this goal:
- 51 achievements out of 58 (only 7 story achievements remain, which cannot be collected in a single playthrough)
- all caches looted
- all artifacts and arch-artifacts are found
- all flash drives with equipment upgrades are collected
- all or almost all secondary quests are completed
- all regions and locations in them are visited

I chose the path of the Strelok, purely out of memory of the good old days in SoC, but this arc is not to my liking - I will try others later.

[h2] Top weapons and equipment (Endgame) [/h2]
[u] Armor [/u] - Exoskeleton ""Almaz""
[u] Close range [/u]: Margach D-12MT (unique Saiga D-12) / ""Sotnik"" (unique ""Dnipro"")
[u] Long range [/u]: ""Whip"" (unique SVU-MK S-3) / Gauss cannon
[u] Secondary [/u]: Model Competitor (unique Rhino)
[u] Artifacts [/u]: I've been running for the last 50 hours without any changes:
1) Strange Water
2) Hypercube
3) Thunder Berry
4) Thunder Berry
5) Thunder Berry

I don't know how much artifacts stack on stamina, but I read that physical defense has an upper limit. And since my exoskeleton already gave maximum physical defense, I focused on what is always useful - stamina. Strange Water - for obvious reasons (and although radiation removal was nerfed a bit, its key value is in load capacity), Hypercube - for quick blood clotting.

I left a strong artifact for electrical protection and chemical protection in reserve, but with a fully pumped armor it's easier to quickly run through a dangerous area and grab a first aid kit than to waste time rearranging artifacts. What hotkeys were there for switching between sets of artifacts - that's one thing, but it's too stressful for your hands. And the first aid kits are lying around literally everywhere.
[h1] Impressions [/h1]

It's hard to sit down and trivially divide it into pros and cons. Therefore, I will try to formulate it in a few paragraphs below
[h3] First - The Atmosphere and The Nostalgia [/h3]
It is worth noting that Stalker is a game from my childhood. I was 14 when I played SoC, and at that time it was the best FPS I had played with a plot. This, and the fact that the developer was and is a Ukrainian team, could not leave me aside. Only for nostalgia and a strong pro-Ukrainian position, I could not pass by this game and not support GSC Game World. I bought Ultimate if only because it is a good way to support Ukraine and a Ukrainian product.

However, the first minus crept in right away, in my personal opinion: despite the 17-year difference between the release of SoC and S.T.AL.K.E.R. 2, I actually did not feel any progress in the gameplay. That is: anomalies have become more diverse, opponents are a little more dangerous, and the map is larger. However, the open world still serves as a kind of entourage along the way to the main quest: it is still the same ""go shoot 10 dogs"" stalker, ""find over 9000 caches"" stalker. Caches, in which in 99% of cases there is nothing useful. But more on that later. The main point here is that there was no particular progress in the gameplay. Nevertheless, I consider point #1 of my list to be a ""plus"": you buy the game from a company that supports Ukraine, loves it and what it does, and therefore the game will leave a pleasant aftertaste in any case

[h3] Second - The Gameplay [/h3]
Despite the fact that I spent 185 hours in the game, I can say that I enjoyed it for about the first 20-30 hours, when the gameplay was also closely intertwined with the plot. When you're all nervous and trying to sneak past a couple of bandits, stab them with a knife, and prepare to fight the Flesh as if it were the entire army of the monolith - that's the stalker atmosphere. But the moment the tasks became ""Go kill the gang and their leader"", and also the moment I realized that repairing equipment costs about the same as the reward for the task (or even more) - I stopped enjoying it:
- The AI ​​of opponents has not undergone any serious changes since 2007: all the same ""mobs"" that swarm at you in a chain when you sit around the corner with a shotgun, and you shoot them one by one;
- bandits and military, and other NPCs that are ""hostile"" by default, will spawn and attack you without talking - that is, I would still understand random attacks, but this is inadequate behavior - even bandits would most likely first ask who are you, and the military and even more so - they would try to rob, but would not just shoot a stalker at the first sight of him - that is, there are no innovations here
- there are also no innovations in the base protection system: you can kill the entire 'Ward' base, or the Military base, and no one will raise an eyebrow. Developer could introduce some kind of alarm system: an influx of special forces, helicopters, tanks, etc. For example, in a story mission where I had to infiltrate the Military base on the ""Sphere"" location, I infiltrated it through the basements using stealth, but for some reason I could only exit through the ""top"" levels, e.g. going straight to the surface with dozens of hostile soldiers - that's when I realized that killing 40 of them is not a problem for anyone
- hundreds of hidden caches, which in terms of interest resemble question marks on Skellige: according to my observations, only 1 in 10 will have at least something valuable, and this valuable thing is usually a flash drive with an improvement, which is essentially just an element of grinding; there are a lot of valuable caches in Pripyat, where I found about 10 exoskeletons - though I didn't need them because of the fully pumped ""Almaz""
- ""killing"" radiation, which has been present as ""impenetrable"" walls since 2007: at the same time, putting up story doors and locks is not a problem, but for some reason instead of invisible walls there is radiation that kills you almost instantly if you poke through it and realize you went the wrong way; the guy is furious, with such success it would be better to put up impenetrable walls
- an economy system that made my buttcheeks hurt: minimum payments for difficult tasks, while repairing guns or armor costs from several thousand to several tens of thousands; accordingly, if you want to properly upgrade weapons and armor, you need to run around like a kleptomaniac and drag piles of garbage to buy from merchants who also pay pennies even with a good reputation

[h3] Why did I enjoy the first 20-30 hours?[/h3]
- Mutants are really more interesting: it was fun to study their attacks, learn to aim at those who can run fast or hide. For example, flesh or boar try to knock you down, a dog-dog creates copies, the first bloodsuckers are generally tin. But when I figured it out, the most fun is to kill a dangerous mutant with a few aimed shots. I remind you that I played the game on Veteran, without switching, and the first bloodsucker (story) killed me 20 times. By the time I left Zalissya, I could put him down with 5-6 shots from a shotgun, and I learned to grin at his jumps.
- More interesting anomalies: for reference - I only played SoC and CS, so maybe I missed something. But I liked crawling with a detector in these anomalies: here you have both good old electrics and carousels, but also chemical bubbles, and ""crackers"", and psi anomalies, and anomalies in space-time. Arch-anomalies are generally a song, but there are also cool ones that are not marked on the map at all - such as several train cars that ""glued"" into one
- ""Easter eggs"" in the dialogues and on the map - there were many small moments that pleased
- Shooting guns feels really nice: not the best gunplay I've seen, but still good",positive
"The game is not complete, horribly optimized, very low effort put into the AI and how they move and interact. I have had constant crashing problems which began with the compiling shaders issue and now has evolved into random crashes since the latest patch. I can tell that the game has amazing potential but should not be sold at full price in its current state. The game has severe balancing issues and feels like more of an arcade shooter than a hardcore horror/survival game. The survival aspects are almost non existent as food and other supplies are abundant and there is no real feeling of progression or achieving anything. I am new to the stalker series so maybe this is how these games are meant to be and I had the wrong expectations.",negative
"If you're new to the series (and your PC can run it), it's a great entry into the world of S.T.A.L.K.E.R., it's accesible enough and you get to enjoy some amazing graphics, atmosphere and gun play!
The game world feels authentic, is easy to get lost in and the mainstory is decent, maybe even great if you're not super into stalker already!
Honestly, if you never really played any other entry in the series, S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2 will probably blow your mind and make you buy the prequels after you're done with it, the whole series is incredibly unique in what it does and you won't ever find anything that's scratching the exact same itch as what GSC Game World created over the years.

But if you played S.T.A.L.K.E.R. SoC, CS, CoP and all their mods for the last 2 decades:
well... I guess, turn the highest difficulty level on and the HUD off, try to be happy for some new content ...and rest assured that moddb.com will, some sweet day, set you free.
If you're used to getting cheeki breeki in G.A.M.M.A. and Lost Alpha (completely for free, I might add), you might be disappointed by how little fleshed out S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2 is in comparison.
But even though I finished the whole series and dozens of mods, I just can't stop playing Heart of Chornobyl since I got it, it's like crack, you kinda hate it, but you just can't live without it.

Me for my part, I'm just glad to have more S.T.A.L.K.E.R content to play and I can't wait for the juggernaut of a game the modding community is going to make out of this eventually.

So get the game now if you can, GSC died, reanimated and then went to hell and back to bring us this game and in my opinion, for what it is, even with it's shortcomings, they more than deserve the support.
And if you're short on cash, wait for a discount, just get the game.

Good hunting, Stalker.",positive
"I rate it:
Cheeki breeki/10",positive
"Constant improvement and optimization, a great sequel. The zone will always call you back to it.",positive
"I love this game

I get below 60 FPS with resolution that looks like 240p with like 3 guys just walking back and forth and one of them for some reason is peeing at the same time. Some guy in a corner tells me ""I can sell items to him and buy items from him"" and then when I try he is like ""go away why are you talking to me?"", then I go away from him and then tells me ""I can sell items to him and buy items from him"" and he keeps repeating it all the time. Then my main quest bugs and I have to backtrack like 1 hour because I shot some bandit too close to the quest, also I had been looting that whole 1 hour and running back and forth to sell it. That was really fun to loot everything again and running like super slow because you can carry about 1 piece of bread and 1 bottle of vodka without hitting the weight limit. Combat is really cool because bandits can shoot through walls and they engage in long range combat with shotguns for some reason. Also they got night vision and can see me in the dark and also through walls when it is dark so actually night wall vision but they can also do it when the sun is up for the whole 3 minutes in the day/night cycle so night light wall vision. Mutants are really complex to fight they run back and forth to attack you and you can jump on a rock and then they stop working. Some of the mutants need more than their body weight in ammunition before they die for some reason, I really like that I need to use like 500 shots to kill them while standing on a rock so they don't 2 shot me with some sort of kindergarten slap or Pikachu tackle or headbutt or whatever it is called. Also you bleed like aaaaaaaaaall the time like you got that bleeding disorder where your blood can't clot and the cool one is called von Willebrand disease. So you eat some sharp salami or step on like sharp mud and you will die without putting a bandage on your arm. So you will always have to carry 400 bandages, which is quite optimistic actually. 

Actually guys, I hate this game.",negative
good game,positive
"I enjoyed this game a lot. I'm 49 and played every morning before work for quite a time and finished up today. The game really captured my imagination and there was a lot to think about. I'm not much of a shooter player, so I played on easy mode with mods that made it so that I could carry a little more weight and so that repairs cost a little less.

I ran into lockups - about a dozen of them, total in 94 hours. They all required me to restart my machine because I couldn't even get to Task Manager. This was annoying. I ran into one situation that was almost a soft-lock: At one point, I had to talk to Richter but I couldn't initiate dialog. I got around this by fast traveling away from the area, waiting a few minutes, and fast traveling back, which saved my playthrough. There could have been more sidequests near the end.

The thing that I appreciate most about this game is the environment. The graphics, sound, and atmosphere were top-notch and really kept me coming back, even during long sections of the game where I was just walking from one place to another. I had no problem picking up the game for an hour and just wandering around.

This was recommended to me as a survival horror game. I'm just getting into horror games so I asked for recommendations. I would not call it a horror game, but there were times when I was exploring abandoned labs at night with only my flashlight for company, being hunted by mutants, where I can see why you'd at least say that it has horror elements. The survival aspects are forgettable, not playing much of a role in the game because resources are so plentiful.

I liked the characters a lot. My favorite characters were Richter and especially Korshunov.

The developers are good about patches and updates.

All in all, I'm very glad that I got this game, and highly recommend it. I started playing on an i10900 with a 4080 and finished on a Ryzen 9 9900X with a 5080. 64GB RAM in both cases.",positive
"Such a bummer, huge fan of the series but the optimization makes the game literally unplayable. I thought maybe it was my PC, but I went out and bought a whole ass brand new computer and literally nothing changed.",negative
Bugged mess,negative
"Gameplay is solid with a good loop. It runs terribly. Even with a 5900x and an RTX 3090 I don't maintain 60 FPS in most areas regardless of graphics settings, but it is very playable. If you like the Metro games or Fallout you will probably enjoy this.

Edit: Best cool rock collector simulator of all time.",positive
"As it stands and after the latest patch I have lost hope that this game will ever have a functioning a-life. The game is basically an atmospheric ubisoft-slop style game. If you are into that go for it, but it is nowhere near the quality of the previous games. Thank the modders who for whatever reason seem more capable than the devs and have improved the game immensly. I strongly recommend Modular Hard Mode or Maklane Zone Overhaul + Shay Living zone (for some semblance of a life)",negative
Just the right amount of soviet era depression.,positive
all good,positive
"It's not Fallout. It's a survival game set in an incredibly atmospheric alt-history version of the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. If you're expecting it to be an RPG like Fallout, then you'll be disappointed. But if you enjoy Fallout's post-apocalypse style and atmosphere, then you'll like this game. Just be prepared to die a whole hell of a lot.

Think of it like an improved version of the first three S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games. Play those first!",positive
"I've gained game developer skills and Unreal Engine 5 knowledge in order to complete this game.
Play and learn. Totally recommend it.",positive
"I have played every stalker game up to date and this is by the far the worst there is. I can't even comment on the story because I literally can not get passed the first 30 minutes of the game. I literally do everything to get my computer to run this game and it still crashes and tears so hard that another dimension might as well rip open through my screen.

This is freaking ridiculous. I bought this game a day or two after Christmas, played for 3 hours, of which 2.5 was figuring out how to make the game run smooth. But nothing. The game literally does not work at all. I then waited for more updates. Then came out this ""1700"" fix update and it still runs like shit. I literally can not play this game anymore. How do you justify making the three previous stalker games then make this bs and be happy about it. 

Until this fix this garbage I am not playing it. No one should. In fact, the only people that are enjoying this game are those who can afford to toss up to date specs at a game that will still put those specs through the meat grinder. HOW!?!?!? I want to make it clear that my pc is not even 2 years old and I'm having the worst experience possible. Fix this POS game.",negative

"As a long-time fan of the original STALKER trilogy, I had high hopes for STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl. Unfortunately, without ALife, the game feels hollow—a beautiful but lifeless shell of what made the series special.

For those unfamiliar, ALife is not just a spawning system. It was the beating heart of the original games, making the Zone feel alive, unpredictable, and immersive in a way no other game has replicated. It created dynamic interactions between NPCs, mutants, and the world itself—without scripting, without artificial control. The Zone lived on whether you were there or not.

The idea was conceptualized in 2001 and its first implementation on the market was on 2007 (toned down) for the 1st game (STALKER Shadow Of Chernobyl).
In 2008 Clear Sky had a very competent ALife.
So... Imagine that this technology is not new at all.

If you want to understand what ALife truly was, watch this:
https://youtu.be/VcIeAEm5FBk

For the Developers:
I understand the game is still in a rough state, and bug-fixing is the priority. But even if you polish every texture, fix every crash, and optimize performance, without ALife, STALKER 2 will never feel like a true STALKER game.

Please, bring back the ALife system from the original trilogy. Right now, this game is missing the essence that made the Zone an unpredictable and terrifying place to exist in.

I really wanted to recommend this game, but in its current state, it does not live up to its legacy.",negative
Npc's spotting you through terrain makes this game frustrating,negative
"Very unplayable in it's current state...
-very frequent random drops to 10fps, which temporarily goes away when mouse is violently shaken (RTX3060, i5 11500h, 32gb RAM). CPU/GPU/RAM/VRAM usage is fine. Last update did NOT fix this issue, even though it stated so.
-bad optimization (UE5, what did we expect?)
-AI lacks basic intelligence...
-in some aspects the game feels shallow, especially in comparison with the previous titles (missing a lot of mechanics - stealth, factions, disguise, etc)

It does have some good points though:
-graphics
-environment details
-atmosphere

In my opinion this game should've not been released yet. I wouldn't even call it an early access title, a beta release would've been more a appropriate title. The flashlight missing the basic shadow projection found in any >2010s game (that being until last week's patch) proves my point entirely.
Hopefully it will become a good game in the end, just like CP77 did.",negative

"Meme review: 
I am now a stalker in both ways.

Actual review; 
1st) My character needs to take some cardio training lessons... That or he needs to lose some weight because he sprints for 5 seconds and then sounds like he has asthma and can barely move, this is annoying considering how big the map is and paired with how easily you become over encumbered.

2nd) The start of the game is far better (in my humble opinion), due to resources being scarce compared to late game having abundant meds and ammo, it looses the intense and fear inducing aspect.

3rd) After loosing the fear inducing aspect it becomes apparent the game is being more story based instead which is fine and all but jees, I personally found the story to be very confusing.

overall;
Simply good, it launched in quite a buggy state but big games are familiar with this now, (the developers are working to fix them), as long as you enjoy in-depth confusing story the late game is as good as early game, and the slow movement is part of this series' niche for realism I suppose.",positive

"I think this game is a lot of fun in places.  Now i've reached a point i feel isn't even that far in and i can't roam anywhere without fighting armies of all the variety of enemies every step i take, using up the massive amount of resources and ammo i thought i would never run out of.  every time i go to play it and try to see if the never ending bullcrap will end with all these enemies that don't even drop loot since only humans do, so all i'm doing is burning resources faster than you could believe, and then die, no matter how hard i try or how far i run away, so i lose all motivation to play and just close the game again.

when i first started the game, i would clear a platoon of enemy, turn around and another platoon would spawn within seconds of my back turned everywhere i went.  they fixed that in a patch.  but the same issue still exists imo and with enemy that you can't even resupply off of or get any type of trophy to sell to npcs.  i would probably refund this if i could.  was a lot of fun till now.  its not the difficulty its the never ending spawning of invisible mutants that take loads of clips to kill and i can't even just run from them after i killed like 10 of them i said screw it and tried to run.  where i ran was just worse.",negative

The very best combat, weapons are diverse and realistic. If I have a single gripe it would be as with the first three, an irritation in the enemies ability to deliver a grenade with astounding accuracy at your feet from virtually any range.

I find the story line pretty alluring, but at the same rate there's lots of side activities that keep me from progressing to fast through the story which is good. The combat is fun and can be challenging at times, and the various types of mutants keep things interesting. As long as as youre good at scavenging, youll never really run out of supplies it seems. Dont know if its the autism or ADHD but ive spent more time in this game in 3 weeks than i have in any other in the past 2 years probably lol. Its just easy to enjoy. Seems to be quite difficult to run tbh. Ive got a 9800X3D and a 3090 and i average around 80-100 fps in non-strenuous areas. But there are also no loading screens except for when first booting up the game so i can imagine thats not easy to do. The game is beautiful though, the somewhat long walks between locations and killing bandits are easy due to that fast. You can tell the davs have put alot of work into making the zone feel alive and real.",positive
"Said it initially, but nobody wanted to believe it - at first anyway, lol.

The game is slop held together by ductape. The AI, the feature Stalker was initially known and cherished for, is terrible this time around. Straight downgrade in every aspect. It's not even decent. It just is, as with any other budget 1st person shooter. Whether you call it ""A life"" simulation or just NPCs doesn't change the fact that it's completely unremarkable. Just to be clear: it wouldn't be noteworthy if it would work as intended either, which it doesn't. But just saying.

Graphics are meh. Stalker one with a few light modifications looks better. Gunhandling is REALLY meh. Story is... alright. I guess? Nothing to write home about, but it's probably the most solid aspect about this project. Its features and mechanics are less immersive than the older Stalker games. It's really bad.

Mixed reviews are generous and I suspect that it were a lot more negative if people 1.) hadn't been so hyped about the prospect of a proper Stalker successor and 2.) the narrative that the developer struggled because of the war. Which I'm sure they did. The result is still entirely lackluster and not worth 60 bucks though. It's okay to be honest about it. Listen, if you want the true Stalker experience, get the old games and modify them to your heart's content. It's an incredible ride and it's really not too complicated. 

Otherwise, there is no, absolutely ZERO reason I would recommend this game to anybody when there is the Stalker mods, and even newer games like Metro for 5 bucks. Metro is a much better take at a spiritual successor to Stalker as it is more immersive, has a better story, better graphics, better open world, more believable characters, better AI and so forth.

"I am an ultra-fan of the stalker games as well all things post apocalyptic. Spending many hours in the metro games and others alike. I love this genre and want games like this to succeed. As excited as I am for this, it feels blah.. 

The combat is not rewarding or engaging. The difficulty comes from the mobs being bullet sponges. 
The AI 100% needs work (I know they are working on it). 

The hunger system is more annoying than anything else. Food is everywhere and your guy is hungry every 5 minutes. It just feels like a hindrance task more than anything else. Doesn't feel like it holds any value other than to make you click the buttons.

The health system... way too simple. We have so many games that redefine the health system and combat styles like GZW & EFT. I am not advocating for stalker to be EFT, but I feel stalker would be So much better with a robust health system. Broken bones, surgical kits, bandages, splints etc.. This would make you actually thinking about how to move around the map.

The armor and guns system - it doesn't feel like different guns matter? The mobs still eat head shots from snipers and ARs. Plus, wouldn't it be better to add mags with bullets. Not just randomly smashing R after every fight. This would also allow you to add more armor types - chest rigs, pants, gloves helmets etc.. (Much like those games stated above)

The world is beautiful, but empty..  Feels like a walk/ running simulator most of the time. Which feels like an annoy time gate for zero reason.
There is no point to search through building? just empty rooms, some pointless anomaly, or a stalker cache that holds no value.
Maybe at a crafting system? add the PDA talk like previous stalker titles? Add random events to the world?
add a vast travel? Idk the world is too big and beautiful to be so empty. 

There is sooo much potential to make this a living zone that you could stay engaged with for years... its just not there yet.. 

To sum up, I guess I feel the game is way to simple for the times? I agree the world is beautiful to look at, but we shouldn't let our past experiences with stalker games bind us. This game could be SO MUCH MORE!

God.. I hope something changes... Mods?.. I guess?

"With Patch 1.2, the game runs well on my PC. While I do experience some performance issues, nothing makes the game unplayable though a few cutscenes drop to a handful of FPS. In-game, however, I never dipped below 60 FPS, even in high-performance areas like Pripyat.

Bug-wise, I encountered two major issues that forced me to reload my last save and restart the game (one hardlock and one freeze). Aside from that, only minor bugs disrupted immersion but didn’t break the game. Sadly, the missing A-Life system is a noticeable absence.
Ratings

    Story: 9/10
    Choice Impact: 7/10 (I’m a simple man, being able to comfort Richter and seeing him thank me later was a nice touch.)
    Graphics: 9/10
    Gunplay: 9/10 (Though it’s disappointing that low-to-mid-tier weapons fall off hard in the late game, especially since the HK416 looks amazing.)
    A-Life: 3/10

Overall Thoughts

The story is fantastic, and game-breaking bugs are rare. While walking long distances might seem tedious at first, you can find artifacts that increase endurance regeneration, making it much more manageable. Plus, the world is worth exploring.

Mutant health being high makes perfect sense, you’re just a stalker, and other stalkers are easily taken down. Mutants, on the other hand, are straight-up cosmic horror. You’re just some dude with a gun and armor, not a superhero.

If you want the full S.T.A.L.K.E.R. experience with A-Life, you might want to wait until it’s patched in or play Anomaly/Gamma in the meantime. But as it stands, I definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys S.T.A.L.K.E.R.

"This game is missing so many basic gameplay features that made the franchise good like being able to actually trade and have dialogue with random npc's but now there's only one option of dialogue. There's also no effective way to make money unlike previous titles where you could go to barkeeper's and traders to get quests to make money but instead you can only do one quest to get a measly 900 coupons and then you have to wait to do any more, the only quest that gives more are the artifact quests and good luck getting the actual artifact. On top of that it has some of the worst performance i've seen in a while and still it hasn't improved. Fighting mutants is terrible, especially bloodsuckers and pseudogiant's, bloodsuckers never give you a chance to shoot them without knocking you down similar with pseudogiant's that also almost never give you a chance to shoot because they're always chasing you and always knock you down when slamming unlike the previous titles where you could jump over the shock wave to avoid damage this game doesn't and for my first pseudogiant encounter i had to lower the difficulty to the easiest setting and i still died to it and used up all of my ammo when i finally killed it. There are so many things like the way they designed enemies to anomalies to the severe lack of a proper faction reputation and A-life system that make me hate this game and i was looking forward to it ever since it had been announced .",negative

"-Controls designed for console, graphics designed for the 15 people that purchased a 5090
-A UE5 project pushed with default settings (motion blur, input smoothing, DLSS by default? Headbob so your bad FPS looks even worse)
-You need to install mods to get even basic FPS controls functional, and spend 30 minutes messing with your controls (Why is lean not Q and E? why long press for some hotbar actions?)
-You also need endless ini tweaks, or a mod, to get even a semblance of decent frame timing
~2.6 hours played, only 15 minutes of gameplay and was just annoyed the entire time

Recently they released a ""massive patch"" for the game.. . It has everything... except a-life fixes , and serious, game changer fixes, so after all I deleted this piece of console poop from my PC. 
Lets be honest: this game cant be fixed, because its a console game that must run flawlessly on couple of hundreds of dollars worth consoles. 
I built my PC from 3k and is capable of running every AAA games on ultra settings. The stalker 2 will never be fixed , because it must meet with the console level, and the console level never in this lifetime can be a match for a PC.

"It pains me a little to hit ""No"" ... 

as much as I loved the immersion into this beautifully crafted world, the fun gunplay, and great artifact hunting, this world reveals how shallow it actually is with every hour you put into it. There's hardly any interaction with anything in the Zone. There's hardly anything to do other than walking for ages from quest marker A to quest marker B, trying to somehow follow the extremely confusing dialogues that will tell you to walk for ages to quest marker C. And that's unfortunately all there is. Compelling sidequests are an absolute rarity. 99% of all NPCs have nothing to tell you.

At no point did I have any idea what the main quest is actually about. At no point did I care - I was so fascinated by this world and the nostalgia bonus from having played the first Stalker decades ago. Then again, hour after hour, this bonus faded, the fascination became mundane, and I lost interest even in finishing the main questline.

I might come back to this in a year's time or even longer. In it's current state, Stalker 2 is not more than a decent shooter. Without the franchise naming, I doubt that it would've gotten a whole lot of attention.",negative
"Keybinds don't work properly, especialy on Numpad, making the game unplayable. Negative until fixed.",negative
"After playing the game for a ""decent"" time, all i can say is, this isn't the stalker of years gone by.
While the game looks great, and the gunplay is much better, it lacks depth. the story is mid at best, and the AI is even worse. 
in perspective, lets say you're fighting some blind dogs, a pack. while you may think it's best to jump up on a box or truck to avoid their attacks, you'd be wrong. The AI in this game seems to have a psychic sense to when you're out of their reach, and as such they will run into cover and stay there until you touch the ground again.

Stalker 2 HAD potential, but unfortunately the DEVs screwed up.
Don't expect a living world like the previous games, there is no real A-Life in this game, at best you'll have random generic npc's spawning in a bubble around you.

This isn't stalker, this is the call of duty 10 of stalker, devoid of it's true nature, and turned into a sympathetic cash grab. 
all in all, you will have a much more enjoyable time plating the original trilogy, and then moving on the the modding scene with anomaly, which, till this day proves to be the ultimate stalker experience. 
5/10 this could've been great, but the dev's screwed over A-Life and somehow also messed up AI.",negative

PROS:
- enjoyable gameplay, storyline tolerable

CONS:
- Zone feels so small yet it is so big; so many opportunities missed - completionist time around 100hours. scarcity of combat
- you need to be immune to numerous AI imperfections (NPCs hitting target on such a long distance that you cannot see them) and bugs (happened to encounter around 5-6 major bugs in around 100hours of gaming) 
- new patches introduced additional imperfections",positive
"I don't know what Patch 1.2 did but it broke the game for me. I die randomly and enemies take literally 200 rounds to kill, even 4-6 head shots sometimes doesn't do it. Mind you this is on the stalker difficulty and even rookie is ridiculous with bullet sponging. Mutants take too much ammo to kill as well. Also the A-Life that was present in the earlier series is broken and enemies will spawn on top of you causing you to die over and over again for no reason, lose resources fighting a horde of Monolith that spawned on you and have to run all the way back to another settlement to get more ammo. This game looks great and the visuals are stunning but the game play is absolutely horrendous. 

Do not play this game until they fix it.

Also I do understand that they are literally at war In Real Life.",negative

It looks good in pictures but plays like crap. The bad performance, crashes, glitches and lack of variety might make you think at first this game needed another year or two cooking but it's worse than that. 

Even after the thousands of fixes the most recent patch addressed it still runs crap. 
My most recent experience after said patches was, load in, game still runs like crap, get shot at, return fire, more enemies spawn on top of me, game crashes.

All round It's just a really bland game that starts off good, lures you in but gets worse the more you see. Most of the loot you'll find in the first 30 mins is the same stuff you'll be seeing after 40 hours, all the voice actors are from the north of england making this less heart of chornobyl and more heart of northumberland, walking around the zone can be atmospheric but the moment you interact with an npc or story the game feels like a poorly written indie title.

"I would wait a couple of years before getting it until they fix the many problems this game has, too many bugs, forcing FSR or DLSS and fake frame generation because without it the game can not run over 50-60 fps and it looks like a blurry mess.

BUT 

i was soft-locked out of the main story for so long because i couldn't finish the bugged mess of the main Q line, i did play the originals way way back and its nothing like the original essence and feel you got from those original games, In my opinion for those who haven't played stalker its a Russian/Ukrainian version of fallout to kinda to simplfy it, i feel the enviroment is abit dead just strolling along the wastes have the encounters of mobs spawning behind/in front of you, mutants that seemingly flick you and you die. 

I have tried to get into it but i feel as of waiting so long just to pickup where i left off has kinda put me off and feels like a chore to get through it - I would recommend others to try it out as it is a decent game to a degree its just one of them leaves me in limbo 50/50 like marmite you either like it or don't.",negative
With the latest patches this game is becoming increasingly better balanced and a challenge with much less frustration. I recommend restarting if you started previously because the experience is very different now.,positive
"I'm very big fan of Stalker, really. All three parts of first stalker where my life. I was so much excited to finally play second Stalker, I even bought limitetd box edition and I was very happy about it. But at the beginning I must say one thing: when you play Stalker 2, there is something wrong when you all the time thinking about coming back to your awesome game modded Stalker GAMMA.

Beggining of the game is quite enjoyble, its obvious that creators made a lot of effort to you to have a good time in the Lesser Zone. Its fun, Its new, lot of interesting quests. You are just stunned of amazing graphics, guns are amazing. BUT, as you move deeper to the zone, more emptiness you feel. Garbage is still quite fun, but as main story goes on and on, it feels like more: walk here, walk there. I wont to talk about Swamps here, it was terrible and many, many hates has already been saied about it. Anyway middle game feels more like more emptiness than it should be.

Weight you can carry is just wrong made, especially when you realise you take so many ammo you can carry (its not so much), then you meet some mutants, waste all of your ammo and gets no loot, you have to come back to ressuply and go again and guess what? mutants just respawned... Its just pain, trust me. While talking about mutants, I expected much more from Stalker 2. They are stupid, unbalanced, just waste of time and resources killing them, its just not fun at all. 

Gunfights with enemy would be fun, yes. But when in the middle game and mostly in engame sends against you only super equiped enemies, all of them with exosceletos, that should be quite rare, now everyone gets one. Its just seems not right when stupid Ward blocs huge pard of the zone from you and all around you just find Ward soldiers or never ending numbers of monolithinas, everybody in exosceletons. It seems something wrong about it. And tell me: what the hell supossed to be the sniper instant death when you are close some parts of the map? Just WTF?

There was also some issues about money system, especially when you need to repair your stuff, you instantly waste all of your money, and you cant repair yourself at all, but I belive some new updates made it little better. But when I stared to play this game, it was really horrible. 

Yes, there are still some minor (and major!) bugs with the storylines, but I dont want to talk about them, They are just lost in my past and dont want to remember it. Anyway there where many others who saied A LOT about bugs here, so check it out.

So in the end I wanted to press button ""not to recoment"", but I want to support all GSC team as much as possible, I admire them a lot, so I press ""I recomment"", BUT.... I'm not happy about this game. Amazing graphics and good gunfights are not all gamers wants. There are some techniccal issues you can deal with yes, but make game enjoyble, it takes much more than that. I'm going back to live free in Stalker GAMMA to enjoy the zone and hope for better future for Stalker 2. Thanks.",positive

"The most whining about S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2 is the bugs and memory leak, That has and being ironed out. Some hardcore S.T.A.L.K.E.R fans whining about the older series is/was better ofc, But is it? No! The series was plauged with bugs and gamebreaking crasches, Ai, animals and npc was dumb as heck etc etc.. It was bearly playable for a loong time, but that do the hardcore fans don´t want anyone to know..

I have spent at least 400h++ without and with mods playing Shadow of chernobyl, Clear sky and Call of Pripyat in the old days and i would say S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2 IS better in seriously many ways..

- The details in S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2 is seriously huge, calm down when you play and just look around you, The world is alive and have some seriously detailed awesome moments..
 
- It is NOT a ""go there, do this"" only as many whines about! The first i did when start playing was to explore and doing side quests. At ~150h in i found the best detector. (I prefer Bear detector).

- There are many many ways to play S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2 in what style you prefer to play. Sniper? absolutly, Crazy Tank? Yep, Rambo? and so on and on..

- You have sometimes choices when talking with npc´s that has different outcomes..

- It sometimes has 200iq+ moments and WTF IS THAT!!

- All animals and weird monsters are Final bosses so either hide and cry or ruuun.. (atleast before you starting to get some good shotguns and armor..

The negative i think sometimes is it can be a little too easy with some aspects.. the game gives you ALOT of healthpacks and anti-rads so i recommend Hard or worse. And one mod that change the healthpack instant full hp to gradually giving health.

Don´t listen to the whining, give the game a chance. It is a wonderful game in many huuge aspects..",positive

"To start off, i played the original trilogy a long time and have not touched it since so this review is solely for the experience in Stalker 2. 

While i do admit that the game suffers from bugs and sometimes these bugs require a restart from a previous save or cause crashing to desktop (so save often), overall the experience of the game is very good. It has something that really brings me back every time and i enjoy my time in the world immensely. It is a well crafted, visually beautiful and engaging game capturing very well the essence of a survival in wasteland game.

So please give it a chance, the developers are putting hard work into fixing everything and we have constant patches that evolve the game in the right direction. Also consider the fact that this is a small Ukrainian studio and you can see that this game is their labour of love. Comparing to the big studios putting out a ton of low quality, unfinished games, we need more of these small studios raising up the bar.

Wholly recommended but patience with the existing bugs (none of which I considered game breaking) and the game will become a true gem in time. Thank you!",positive

"With mods it runs pretty good, but otherwise after a few patches (beyond 1.2) I think Stalker 2 will be a much better experience technically. 

Otherwise, Stalker 2 has lots of really fun moments, the tone is great, the environments are superb, and the multiple paths through the game are greatly appreciated. Plot wise it can be hard to follow, but thats what you get for playing a modern game written in another language about a fantastical zone of inexplicable anomalies around the Chernobyl reactor. 

A worthy successor to the earlier stalker games that takes the story even further and I'm looking forward to what GSC does next. But please for the love of god make it run better. 

Couple criticisms now that I've reached the end. 
1. I hate running, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 has a much better in game fast travel system where it feels dangerous but you can still navigate around the map without running for 30 minutes. 
In Stalker you have to find Guides who can only get you to the closest inhabited camp to your destination. 
2. The end feels like it keeps throwing new and better weapons at you in the last few hours, I wish the equipment I lugged across the entire map were useful in the end section as I grew quite attached to the guns and the playstyle I developed. You have a variety of weapons to choose from at the end, but there are definitely some that are better than others and I wish you could rock up with your shotgun from early in the game and still successfully run through the corridor shooting moments at the end. 
3. English VO is extremely uneven, played with Ukrainian all the way through. 

Buy if you're looking for a long RPG/shooter experience where exploration is one of the main draws.

Some side missions are genuinely fun and worth finding where as some are your basic eliminate enemies and find loot basic missions. This game is intended to be played as a stealth game, picking and choosing your battles and fighting when you have to, if you want to go in all guns blazing, especially in harder difficulties, the amount of ammo and resources you spend will make it a costly choice. Overall, at the time of writing this review, i would not recommend this game unless you are fully aware of this games style, if youre looking for a casual experience, i suggest looking elsewhere, as even on the lowest difficulty you need to manage your inventory, conserve ammo and choose your battles wisely or find yourself back at a pervious save point. If you are looking for a genuinely hard, semi-realistic shooter with punishing mechanics and somewhat interesting story i would start by reading reviews or watching Youtube videos to manage expectations and jumping into S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2 with the knowledge that it is a game intended to test you.",negative

Even with all the patches the game refuses to run correctly. I can not recommend this game in its current state.,negative
"I gave it the benefit of the doubt, as the early game was enjoyable and the technical issues weren't [i]too[/i] bad, but the back half of the game just falls apart completely, both technically and in terms of design. As the game's gone on, the performance has deteriorated more and more - if the updates have improved things, I'd hate to have seen the late game before then - and the missions/levels have become endless gauntlets of bullet-sponge enemies that will kill you in one or two shots.

I've reached what I believe is the very last combat encounter in the game, and I'm going to have to either enable Unreal's console commands or watch the ending on YouTube. It's a perfect storm of too many enemies, in too small a space, who take too many bullets to kill, and who can kill you too quickly. I've watched videos online where people show you how to bait enemies out and pick them off, but for me they won't spawn until I pass a threshold I can't backtrack through, and leave my cover behind. Having fought through performance issues, bugs, crashes, unbalanced and unfair encounters, to have been defeated this close to the end has left a very sour taste.

I have plenty of gripes, but instead of an exhaustive list, the tl;dr is: the game needs a [i]lot[/i] of work, on performance, QoL, balance, and encounter design. Maybe GSC will make that happen, maybe modders will, but I think I'll just take the YouTube way out.",negative
Best current graphics.,positive
"This game is Not Worth playing in its state right now.
The World feels dead, Gunplay still feels janky, 90% of guns are fking broken so no idea how the ai use em. 
side mission rewards are not rewarding. all enemies tend to just move in straight lines.  no idea where the hell i'm tossing a nade just pray it gets them. . . Fear that its at my feet. 
its pretty bad when the beginning of the game just has no soul to it makes you not really want to continue.
I would suggest waiting a couple years then check the games progress.",negative
"It is a really good shooter with lots of gear BUT:

- The map is gigantic and the cunning around is so annoying and take all the fun. You would need more safe houses.
- The economics are bad, you always low on money and you miss out on lots of upgrades. So you gotta think before you spend.
- The story is confusing.

Overall it is still a really good 4/5 stars.",positive
The last half of the game is clearly unfinished and rushed. Might as well call this an early access title with the amount of bugs and poor AI. This game needed 1-2 more years to finish.,negative
"This game has great potential, but as it is right now, I can't play it anymore. The last update really messed up my game, and I've decided to uninstall. I really tried looking past all the issues, but this game is far from finished. Trying to find the right balance of visuals and performance seems impossible. It either looks great and performs poorly, or it looks awful and you get reasonable frame rates. I got it to a playable state (with mods), but I want to say almost half of my playtime was spent trying to find the right settings and mods. They also removed some mechanics from the first game that made sense to expand on or at least bring over to this one, but they’re nowhere to be found. It’s a lot of little things that make everything feel unpolished. The bugs and glitches I can look past (to an extent), but if the game doesn’t feel good to play, there’s no point in playing it. This is an early access game and should have been advertised as such. I understand what’s going on over there, and it’s amazing what the developers are able to do under the conditions, but they’re asking for the money of a finished game without disclosing how unfinished it is. It doesn’t seem right to the people who put aside a good chunk of cash for what they thought was a finished game. I do like this game, and I know it will be great one day, but I would not recommend it at this time. Play the first one if you haven’t.",negative

"Waste of money and time. I quit around [spoiler]Assault on Duga, didn't side with Ward at SIRCAA[/spoiler] when I realized the game is just not fun anymore and I could barely stomach it.

The human and mutant ai sucks. The weapon balance sucks. Most of the technicians are braindead and can't uprade half the weapons/armor. There's barely anything to do outside the zone. Fighting againsts enemies isn't interesting or fun, especially the mutants. The zone just feels empty and boring. All the locations look super similar. Runs like shit too. The a life ""2.0"" is super shit, shit just spawns around you in a 100 meter sphere. Another thing is that the atmosphere also just feels nonexistent, but maybe that's just nostalgia getting to me. Poor sound design for mutants, they sound less scary and some look less scarier too, and as I've mentioned they're not fun to fight. Both humans and mutants just run at you and thats basically it, they get close and try to kill you, they're not any smarter than a zombie from soc lmao. Factions also just feel dumbed down, but once again, could be just nostalgia. The art style is also pretty bad, the game looks bland imo, probs because of the garbage ue5 engine. Also maybe it's just my headphones but the game is very silent, I have to hella crank up my audio to hear some sort of ambience (besides the music). Also the main menu theme is buggy, which is just hilarious. I hate how you can only choose one job from a vendor, PER DAY, heavily diminishing how much money you can make. If you're for some reason considering to buy this game in it's current state (patch 1.2.1), the best way you can make money is by selling weapons/armor in yellow condition, and sell any excess resources that you don't need. I also don't reccomend playing on veteran, it's not fun at all. I spent around 60 hours on veteran till I switched to stalker diff or however the hell it's called. (P.S I have completed the og trilogy on master without any mods...yes even the accursed clear sky). You barely get any money from selling stuff ( which is the main way of making money in this game). And mutants take forever to kill.

Exploration feels pretty boring too, altough some locations are pretty interesting. Some of the new anomalies are pretty cool too, especially the arch anomalies, those are really cool...wish each area had its own arch anomaly. I also liked the new lore and story but couldn't finnish it because of how bad the gameplay is. The music is also pretty nice, and adds a little atmosphere to a game that otherwise barely has any. And the cinematics are honestly...really good, I liked them a lot. The voice acting is somewhat mixed (played with the ukrainian dub) but overally pretty good. I especially liked Skiff and Richter ukrainian va's, you guys did great :). Loved the newly added ""Ward"" faction too, they are a great addition to the lore imo. They are basically the military but cooler and more interesting. [spoiler]I really wish I sided with them, instead of schizo Scar. With the Ward I could've destroyed this game's version of the zone lmao. Honestly that would have been enough motivation for me to continue playing this shit....but at the same time I didn't want to let down Strider[/spoiler]

I could go on and on, and just rant for hours incomprehensibly. But long story short, it's very dissapointing, and just costs way too much for how little the game offers. There's defo some really cool stuff tbh, but the bad just heavily outweights it. I believe the dev's can still turn this around and make a pretty damn good game, maybe the best stalker out there, but that's gonna take a while. Their recents patches and updates have heavily improved the game. Hopefully in a year or so this game will be way more fun and exciting to play. For now if you want to scratch the stalker itch just play the og's, metro, darkwood or chernobylite. They are cheaper and better alternatives....to this. Or just get stalker anomaly, it's free, way better, and you can mod the hell out of it to suit your needs.

I'd be more than happy to change this review into something more positive once the game is more finished and polished.",negative

"I almost played the entire game trough. ALMOST. The ironic part is i quit at the ""leave no one unsatisfied"" mission
i left unsatisfied, because i can't just gun down 6 exo monolithians, while 5 gauss rifle monolithians snipe me from a distance, without any available cover from the gunfire even when my own exo has like 10% durability and there is no way to leave or even access a storage for yourself.

"5-10 minutes of shaders compiling every startup of the game. 
Grainy graphics that I can't fix and changing graphic settings requires a restart, 
meaning 5-10 minutes of waiting each time after changing them.
After 1 hour of ""playtime"", I've played for 5 minutes.
Update 1.1: Creating the Engine.ini file worked for removing the shader compiling, and it didn't disable achievements either.
Update 1.2: Activating upscaling, but turning it to 100% as in ""no upscale"", removed the grainy textures. 
The game still struggles on many graphic settings, but it removed my biggest complaint.

TL;DR: Too much work for a person to fix the company's mistakes.",negative
"NPC keeeps freezing after the update, and the sudden spawn pop in still happen despite patch said its fixed.
doesn't matter Hostile or NPC, human or dog or mutant, it got a high chance that 1 or multiple NPC will just frozen doing nothing in the middle of firefight. This never happened before the patch. Previously there are NPC that stuck but at least i can tell they are stucked, now its just frozen in empty space.

I have a few mods like able to sell broken weapon, increase weight, more ammo drop and longer day time. didn't ever use any mod that modified NPC behaviour as its more complex to install and i know that would likely get broken when theres patch. But still not sure its just me, the patch is broken or there is hidden mod conflict.

and sad to say the huge patch really didn't improve NPC experience at all. They still pop in right in front of you, most location are plain empty but sudden swarmed when you go in one of the building, and in building where you can see inside from windows still suddenly spawn mutant....and I am not talking about those obviously scripted encounter, just those random spawn in open map.

I was let to believe this is what the patch is trying to address in some youtube review but its not the case for me.",negative
"Mind Blown! Wish I played the previous games. I am seriously impressed so far. I know there a few kinks being worked out and a few bugs still remain but I have been sucked into this game and honestly I'm loving Stalker 2. The patches and fixes are coming pretty fast. I find myself just taking in the scenery from time to time and forget there are bloodsuckers just waiting for me around the corner. I have not been jump scared in forever but Stalker 2 creates the jump scare in all the right ways as you explore. This may not be everyone's ""cup of tea"" but they hit the nail on the head for this kind of game!! Hats off to the Dev's for creating something like this in an actual war zone and completing this beauty for us to enjoy! Oh and the music you hear from time to time on radio's is awesome and I end up chilling in zones just to hear these songs! I hope they update with more songs I have never heard before:)",positive

"A very good game. 
Been looking forward to this for many many years.
Loved the original stalker games as a kid, and i loved this one as well. They nailed the environment and atmosphere of the originals. Its definitely more difficult than the originals imo. Died way more on the hardest difficulty then I died in all the other games on the hardest difficulty combined. 
I had maybe a handful of bugs that messed with the experience, but nothing close to what other people say to have experienced. Nothing game breaking. 
I enjoyed exploring the world. I thought the story was pretty dang well done. I thought that the sound design was very well done.  Overall I thought it was one of the best games ive played in a while. 
There are a few things that I think couldve been done better. I think the spawning and the A-Life were done better in previous games. But every other gripe I had I was very easily able to mod to make to my liking. 
If you loved the previous games you will like this one. Thank you for making my childhood dream of another Stalker game come true.",positive

"Very disappointing, zero immersion, npc ai worse than 20year old games, no A Life, lots of bugs, complete waste of money and time... People that give this game positive reviews must have very low expectations. NPC animations are tragic, painful to look at, nothing feels even remotely realistic. Everything spawns around you, enemy has aimbot and immediately knows where you are. Mutants can't get to you if you are 10cm off the ground stood on something, they run on flat only. Used to be a fan of STALKER, really wanted this game to be good, it's sad to see it produced this way, and for GSC to call this acceptable and release it in such a state... disgrace really. 1/10 Should have refunded this, but was hoping they would fix it in quick updates... Looks like it's unfixable for GSC though,

Hopefully modders will come to save this game... Again 1/10 poor effort of making a sequel.",negative
"I truly want to give this game a thumbs up because the game play, exploration, and story seem fantastic. However, the poor optimization completely ruins the experience—every time I launch the game, it crashes.

"One of the poorest games I have ever played and I've been playing games since Pong back in the 70's.

Not just broken on a technical level (although it is even if some of the glaringly obvious bugs and issues have been fixed), it's also poorly designed. It's the video game equivalent of paying someone to kick you in the balls every 10 minutes. Sure, some people might enjoy that (no accounting for taste) but it's not something I'd recommend either.

It's an open world that seems to discourage exploration by making every interesting location a radio-active hotspot  or an instant death trap. The whole game is nothing more than a masochist's wet dream.

I'm sure there's some fun to be had here, but I honestly can't be arsed to look for it. I might try and continue to get my money's worth but with it being about as much fun as root canal surgery I'm not convinced it's worth the effort.

I hope I can at least save someone else the expense of wasting money on this waste of bandwith. Buy it on the deepest sale possible if you must, or full price if you enjoy being kicked in the balls. Hey, it's not for me to judge you.",negative
not bad,positive
"I've waited ten years for this game, and I've also put 60-odd hours into it. That's why I'm so disappointed to give it a negative rating.

This game is, frankly, not worth it in it's current state. The devs have arguably been proactive in putting out updates to fix the most egregious of problems, but the game is still broken and still unfinished. I have no doubt that it will remain in this state for a very, very long time.

The issue is not that there are a few bugs - entire systems of the game just don't work. 

The old STALKER games were known for having AI that was very intelligent for it's day. They would flank and sneak, use cover appropriately, retreat when necessary and know when to turn up the pressure. Using binoculars, you could watch a team of stalkers fighting a group of mutants and this would be happening all across the in game world, even if you weren't there to see it. Stalkers would have conversations with each other, go on patrols, loot, kill, die and travel - all without the player seeing it. This system, known as the A-Life system, is why the world of the old STALKER games felt so alive. 

This doesn't work in the new game. You will seldom, if ever, find yourself bumping into the same stalkers you met six hours ago at a bar when you go to visit another area. You will almost never see stalkers fighting groups of mutants from far away - you will only ever see this if you are very close to the group. As such, you aren't really a passive observer; you are close enough to the mutants to need to fight them too, you can't just sit back and watch like you could in the old games. 

The AI itself is braindead and glitchy. They will often have pinpoint accuracy behind cover, or in the dark, and therefore be able to instantly kill you without you having any chance to react. Or, they'll be so unaware that you can kill them without any resistance. Be aware that the latter doesn't imply a stealth system - there IS no stealth in STALKER 2. You won't be able to do what you could do in the old games and sneak around with a silenced pistol, sneakily picking off enemies and keeping to the shadows. Stealth is a dice roll, a dice roll that often defies logic or explanation. Do not expect stealth - just expect endless shooting galleries.

Mutants are either so weak that they are trivial, or so overpowered that they are just a chore to deal with. The bloodsucker used to be the most feared enemy in the older games. They had creepy, unnatural, loping strides which made them unsettling to look at. They struck without warning, forcing you to be on your toes once you knew they were around. However, they were quite weak; a shotgun could be used to defend yourself against them. As such, they were a rare enemy that stuck to dark areas and made them more terrifying to explore... but you could kill them. Now, bloodsuckers are so common and telegraph their attacks with the same silly jumpscare that they fail to be scary anymore. They run up to you, make the same irritating (but by no means scary) screech sound, and then appear as if at random. You blast them fifteen times with the magazine fed shotguns like the Saiga, and they die. Or, you jump up on a box and they run around the periphery of the box and never attack you. Fantastic.

The economy of the game is broken beyond measure, and this ties in with the broken quest system. You can go along and do a bounty or fetch quest which can require up to twenty or thirty minutes real world travel time, only to come back and be paid so little that it's not economical to even carry out the task. Stashes contain the same low-level items, most of which are worthless or can be bought cheaply from a trader. Upgrades are arbitrarily limited to certain technicians; this was true of the old STALKER games, but at least you could find the traders easily. 

The world of STALKER 2 is huge, but unlike other huge games like Skyrim or GTA V, you have no easy means of travel. You walk to one side of the map to get the quest from a trader or other named individual, walk thirty minutes to where the quest is, kill whoever or take whatever, then walk back to get the reward. Rinse and repeat. This is further compounded by the stunningly surface level reputation system. There are no side quests for particular factions such as Duty, Freedom, etc. Your reputation with them solely rests on bribing the leader of a faction or doing perhaps one quest for them. You can't slowly build up your reputation with them in exchange for access to new areas or teams of companion fighters. All you do is control whether or not their braindead AI soldiers shoot at you or not. You never learn much about the motivations of certain side characters, their place in the world, or the faction's experiences beyond what a few high ranking members or short voicenotes tell you.

Speaking of voice acting - the English acting is terrible. I kept it on for all of five minutes before switching to the Ukrainian acting. I can't tell you if the Ukrainian acting is any good because I don't speak the language, but I imagine it's much better than the frankly laughable English acting. 

Finally, the performance of the game is absolutely unacceptable. My PC more than exceeds the system requirements, but I am forced into using DLSS setting that turn the game into a fuzzy, fizzing, hissing mess that looks unclear and muddy just to achieve acceptable at best FPS rates. Frame generation is a must for those of us used to 100+ FPS games, and this introduces appalling latency problems. The game's lighting looks poor on reflected water because the forced Lumen raytracing engine has to operate at (in layman's terms) a lower resolution because it's not hardware RT like you mind find in other, better examples of raytracing. It uses software, so to be in any way optimised huge shortcuts have to be made. Baked lighting with an optional hardware RT option for Nvidia users would have been the ideal choice, and still looked good and performed well - instead, we're all forced to use a software RT method that looks poor in many areas and performs even worse. Do not expect much more than 70 FPS without frame generation, even on high end hardware.

As a disclaimer - I am not a new fan of the STALKER series. I played STALKER for the first time shortly after CoP released, and I was so excited for STALKER 2. All this game remains to be is a cautionary tale about getting hyped for reboots and late sequels.",negative

"This is a very good game. I haven't played the previous STALKER entries, but I feel as though so many years later, this lives up to the name. Its got an in-depth story, good progression, as well as a huge fleshed out world to explore, with the game actually pushing you to see each and every region, without it feeling like a slog.

You will see many negative reviews talking about bugs, and while it is true that there are many - and some severe - from the very start the devs have been super committed to listening to community feedback and doing all they can to improve the game and fix every bug they've found. The game has improved a great deal since launch, with lots of bug fixes and balancing being implemented.

As I am writing this review a new update just dropped with over [b] 1700 [/b] improvements and bug fixes. Yep. One thousand and seven hundred fixes. The devs are nothing but committed to making this game the greatest it can be. I can wholeheartedly recommend this game, whether its on sale or not (if its on sale just buy it for gods sake). There will be bugs, but they will be fixed. Hell, when you're reading this there might not be any left, and at least in my personal experience I have had very few, even fewer that were not fixed right away.

If you've played stalker before or haven't heard of it, give it a go. I'm sure you'll like it. 


p.s. if your up for it, I recommend having the game voice in Russian. Adds a bit more to the environment, and I would say that the voice acting overall is better in Russian than English, but English is still good if you don't want to read subtitles.

"Enemies are all bullet sponges who take up to five headshots to kill depending on the weapon you're using. To make it even worse they're all sharpshooters who have perfect accuracy and can see you perfectly in the pitch dark like they have night vision. Gunfights consist of peeking for a single headshot that doesn't even kill a single mob only to have to spam heals behind cover. Speaking of cover, most of it is useless. Enemies can shoot through half of it and if they can't you can be damn sure they're going to be throwing grenades right on top of your head with that aimbot accuracy. Mutants are even worse in the bullet sponge department with them regularly taking absurd amounts of ammo that completely drain not only your supplies, but the durability of your gear. 
There's a great foundation here but some serious tuning needs to be done to enemy health and the AI.",negative
"Don't worry about the time sink cost(?) of this game. If you stick to the main story it wouldn't take you much time at all. 
If you ARE looking for a long format game, this is one of them. I just completed my first playthrough, with over 300 hundred hours, and I still have to replay it a couple more time to get the different endings.

I played a vanilla, un-modded campaign on ""veteran"" difficulty.

I think the main story was well written and the character development made sense and worked well into the main story. All in all, pretty solid and cohesive. The side missions from the traders were the standard fetch quests with a few variations of seek and destroy, but they put more effort into the stories for them than most games we get, so again, pretty good. Mission rewards seemed adequate to me. I played on ""veteran"" difficulty so I don't know how they were for the others, but I had no issues. I think the combat felt good, it was punishing at times, but only because god dang these NPCs can hit them headshots. I'm talking shotgun snipers from past 50 yards out, but again, I'm playing on ""veteran"" so I don't know. The Artifacts and system are cool. I think the anomalous(?) ares should be a little bigger though. Right now they encounters feel too short, kind of trivializes them. The art work they did for them is cool as well. I wish you could zoom in when inspecting them. Solid story and character. 8.5/10

I'm playing in English, and the VO are well done. 7/10 

Performance wise, I'm playing on a 3090ti and ryzen 7 7800x3d

As of patch 1.2(ish), the game runs pretty smooth. I think a lot of the scenery was beautiful and I'm looking forward to seeing how it looks when I upgrade.
There are still a few weird issues with images popping into sight, exosuit frames in standing positions were bodies were, weird outline around plants when looking at water at a distance.... it's all noticable when looking for it, but I'm a generation behind so... meh. 

The audio.... man, the audio. Both phenomenal AND irritating. All the sounds are great. The environmental sounds.... shit got me on edge, made me jump a couple times. The gun sounds were crisp and had that... ""umph!."" The songs on the radio, I was digging them. The irritating part, is that with the environmental sounds, it's like the different tracks from a multi-track recording would drop out randomly. Pop! All the wind sound gone. When it's all working, its great, but when its not, it just reminds you're playing a video game.

"First time playing a Stalker game. Fantastic setting and overall feel to The Zone. Carry weight penalties and the limit on how many guns the player can have equipped at a time forces me to make meaningful decisions about what I want to take with me and what I plan to accomplish every time I leave a safe town. The overworld map is just an aerial picture of the landscape and it's a breath of fresh air not to have dozens of colored icons everywhere calling out every possible piece of content and loot the game has to offer. The recent patch fixed human enemies having superhuman sight and aim. Plenty of variety of guns, ammo types, gear and upgrades to allow for character customization and make exploring worthwhile. The mid to late game mutants are very cool. Some of them can still completely stomp me over 70 hours into the game. I haven't had the kind of issues with bugs/crashes some players experienced and my pc is almost 5 years old now. My first crash was at roughly 72 hours played.",positive

I get its a ""survival"" game but survival should feel like ""Oh i have to travel on this specific trail, through these checkpoints because its safest and ill save ammo and meds"" not ""my entire backpack is ammo because on my 6km walk to this objective i have to pay the ammo tax to all the mutants""

Lets also not forget the randomly spawning A-Life enemies that somehow always spawn in looking at you so you are forced to fight them because stealth does not work at all. Another ammo tax.

Maybe like 3-4 more major updates from now it'll actually be enjoyable and not whatever the hell it is now.",negative
Just a very realistic game,positive
Perfect adaption of the old games feels and mechaniks. Fights are more exciting and fun. Lots of Weapon Smithing. Story lines up great and neat onto Stalker 1.,positive
really good game,positive
"Visually great but I would like for:
1- Better story (the part I've seen at least, lame start with the ""I want a new house"")
2- Content (A-Life what / where? the SoC NPCs had a more varied life)
3- Gameplay (controls feels more restricted than in 2006 games)

Bonus:
*Had to start the game again after losing +20h on the first playthrough and finding a blocking bug (blocked door on Wild Island bunker).
**Now I spent +30 to find another one way further into the campaign (Freezed NPCs at the end of ""Defend Zalyssia"")
So now hopefully in a few months they will release version 1.6 and me and my OCD would be able to complete the game.

They could have done a better job on the old X-Ray engine.",negative
"Review of version 1.1.4 and earlier (but according to many reports, many of these issues still persist in 1.2, especially A-Life ""2.0"", see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcoxAJ5UepY)

The game isn’t finished. It holds immense potential - even GOTY material for 2025 (and definitely not for 2024) - but for now, it’s just early access / open beta. As a hardcore Stalker fan, I have a love-hate relationship with it. Sometimes I'm completely absorbed by the experience; other times, I'm on the verge of giving up. And that’s after mods have fixed many issues for me - or at least made them more tolerable. Of course, you have to be willing to invest time in those.

Strengths and Weaknesses:
- Balance Issues: The balance of both damage and economy feels wildly off. Difficulty seems like an afterthought that wasn’t properly tested. Thankfully, mods significantly improve this area.
- Technical Problems: Occasional memory leaks, crashes, and other technical glitches disrupt the experience.
- Buggy Quests: Items sometimes fail to spawn, certain quests can’t be completed, etc. This even happens with main quests, which can lock your progress. These issues can usually be bypassed with console commands - but only if you’re willing to tinker with mods.
- A-Life (Version 2.0?): This deserves its own critique. The promised improvements are nowhere in sight. In fact, A-Life feels worse than in the original trilogy. Enemies sometimes spawn right in front of you, and NPCs only ""exist"" within a 100-meter radius, making despawning an actual combat tactic. As the promised A-Life is somewhere outside the actual ""existence"" bubble of the Zone, it effectively becomes its own metaphor. It’s clear this system has only just started being worked on by the December 2024 patch.
+ Solid gunplay and RPG elements.
+ Stunning graphics.
+ Compelling story with some great standout moments. Particularly, Strider is possibly one of the best video game characters ever.
+ The Zone itself is an absolutely absorbing masterpiece. The size of the world and its palpable atmosphere of despair are the game’s undeniable highlight.

Stalker fans will probably love this game despite its obvious flaws - sometimes even pretending they don’t exist, while ignoring valid criticisms of others. But for those new to the series - or those unwilling to make do with an unfinished product - I can't in clear conscience recommend this in its current state.

I hope that the game will eventually be finished, bugs fixed and A-Life 2.0 implemented, with mods to refine the experience even further. When that happens, I’ll gladly change this review to recommend it - but leave this part in place as a reminder of the game’s subpar early state. Just as my first impressions with the game will permanently leave a lingering bitter aftertaste.

"My credentials:
The first three games I ever owned on steam 15 years or so ago were SOC, CS, and EFP. 

My verdict:
Nothing will stop the pathetic dicklickers and shills for this oppressively mediocre product. The modding scene for the first games was expansive and worth playing that game for (and will make this one, probably), but mods making the game great doesn't mean the game by itself is great. This game with its already-exposed shortcomings isn't what you want to buy, and a studio with people like Evgeniy and Sergiy Grygorovych in charge of it isn't what you want to support. Even Metro (a series I personally rate poorly) is more faithful to the atmosphere and vibe of the original series than this.

I encourage anyone on the fence to add me and ask me for more details if you want a more personal touch. Don't buy this game - at the very least not yet.",negative

"Many of my friends are big Stalker fans and was very hyped for this game - I've personally not played any of the earlier ones, so this was my first interaction with the Stalker universe and unfortunately it fell through on a lot of points. 

To start off; the game series itself was described as ""eurojank"" by more or less everyone I talked to, and while this might have been very charming back in the late 00's - it felt more annoying than anything in a time were most big titles release in an unfinished state and basically can be called eurojank.

The whole game was played on Stalker difficulty with a required change to Rookie at the very end to be able to progress the story.

[b] Positives [/b]

Guns: The gunplay was surprisingly good; the guns felt meaty, the handling was nice, different guns acted differently and the sounds when shooting was very enjoyable.

Story: The majority of the story felt cool and I often caught myself wondering what was happening around the next corner story-wise.

[b] Negatives [/b]

Most of the stuff I'm gonna mention here has already been mentioned a countless times in other reviews, but I guess its worth mentioning here as well.

Zone: While I assume the zone was meant to feel a bit bleak and empty due to the circumstances in the game, it often caused me to stare at something else on my off-screen. Traversal was at times slow and boring, and due to how some objectives were laid out it felt like a running simulator. Areas being cut off by rivers and few crossing points often lead to massive detours just to cross a small body of water.

Humans: A lot of the people you meet in this game are quite forgettable and rarely feel impactful. The human enemies on the other hand are burnt into my mind with their ability to instantly spot you from afar before you can react, and their godlike aim - shooting you through most objects and even terrain. Their guns seemingly have extreme range and a smaller amount of damage drop-off, being spammed by multiple enemies with shotguns from 100m+ never felt fun. 
Its also worth to note that I on multiple occasions had my game come to a halt from NPCs blocking entryways to various places and objectives - this happened so often that I ultimately had to download the UETools mod and use ghost to get past, this REALLY shouldnt be a problem in a game in 2025.

Mutants: I get that they are the byproduct of the Zone and the radioactivity, but really, what is the point of these? They are mostly bullet sponges and dont really behave any differently from each other. They have no drops or any form for reward at all, which means that you mostly wanna run past these to save resources and durability. 
I assume the intention is that these are supposed to be spooky hard fights but they always ended up feeling annoying and boring, and I would just try to get to an unreachable place so I could spam them with my guns in peace without fear of armor durability loss. 

Spawns: Enemy spawning was horrible and a recurring experience was having enemies spawn almost on top of you, behind a position you already cleared or constantly respawn. 

Durability: While I initially though this stat was cool it quickly became an annoyance. Items lose durability way too fast and the impact it has on weapons was extremely noticeable when I would have my weapons constantly lock up every few shots due to low durability. Repair cost for some of these were also unbelieveably extreme considering how fast they broke. 

Artifacts: As a concept I really liked these and they could've had the ability to spice up your game and character a bit, however these were mostly super minor stat buffs that you'd never notice if you didnt know you had them. As a result of this I ended up with 5-6 of these that I mainly got through the main story or stumbling upon them.

Story: While alot of my experience with the story was mostly positive, it also had some negatives. At a certain point in the game you can easily notice that the story itself gets rushed. The change of pace from the start of the game is very noticeable and quite offputting. 
While I'm going to avoid spoilers I'm just going to say that the last 5-6 hours of the game really felt like a slog and also put you in some fights I'm certain had no or close to no playtesting at all. [spoiler] *cough* Granite *cough* [/spoiler]


To end things off, I think the game really has A LOT of potential - but it has a very long way to go to get there. Alot of features are seemingly missing from the game in general like the sleep deprivation mechanic (this popped up once at around 30 hours into the game and never again) and especially A-Life.

The game is currently a 4.7/10 in my book and I think they should've delayed it by way more than they did.
Hopefully the devs continue working on it so that it can one day be the game its meant to be.",negative
It's finally at a state where I would enjoy my time in the zone. 1.2 update really made a difference.,positive
"If you've played the previous 3 games. then you have a good head start on the type of game this is.  It is worth playing the others first i think, but jumping in straight first is also good. Fantastic game this, waited a long time for it but never lets you down. Just fantastic. Keep up the good work.",positive
solid open world game,positive
yep,positive
"(250+ hours played in game on Game pass on top of the <100 hours through STEAM)
The game has it's flaws my experience personally varied wildly from some of the negative reviews game hardly ever crashed, bugs were annoying but nothing a simple reload and back track wouldn't fix, been getting ~140 fps since launch on almost all high some epic settings on my 
4060ti (eww I know place holder till 50 series bugs and such are sorted out), 
i7-12700k and 
32GB DDR5
In short IMO, if the world interests you enough or the style try it out it's worth it.
Being accessible VIA Game pass you can try the game especially if you are already a current subscriber that's exactly what I did, fell in love with the game, and went all out on the Ultimate Edition that alone should speak volumes to the testament of what this game can be if you just approach it with patience, patience is a virtue.

"Не покупайте и не устанавливайте эту игру, она действительно пустая и скучная.
На секунду вам может даже показаться что это могла быть неплохая игра, что это хейтер ради хейта, но нет, в игре действительно нечего делать. Она не интересная абсолютно пустая. 
Я давал шанс игре каждый патч я правда пытался. Но тут просто неинтересно.
Вся прогрессия сводится к тому чтобы вытащить экзоскелет в начале игры и потом пройтись по абсолютно унылейшие цепочки мейн квестов.
По разнообразию геймплея - это какой-то мезозой просто, абсолютно однотипные беготня за крайне унылыми диалогами. Cюжетку как будто Достали из 2010... Какой-то ребёнок с шапочкой из фольги писал это и всё время приговаривал что это будет шедевр. Можно было просто оставить недосказанность, как в прошлых частях. Потому что если в первое прохождение, ты ещё не цепляешься к вещам и кое-как спасает что теперь есть постановочные сцены, то на второе прохождение когда хоть на секунду начинаешь вдумываться понимаешь что это просто бред. 
Натурально не могу пока придумать ни одной причины играть в это.

"Still not ready, however I am patiently waiting.",negative
"A decent game held back by many issues, Stalker 2 ends up being the worst entry in the series and inferior to the original trilogy in every sense except graphics. The original trilogy was awesome because you explore, you discover the story of what happened to the world and its inhabitants instead of a marker telling you ""Go here, go there"" like a shopping list in a grocery store. The essence of the franchise is gone, your choices have less weight and the map is designed to make you waste time by giving you a ""walk here 6 km"" for every quest in the midgame. Traders disappear, whole cities are disabled and if you don't join the WARD in the story, you are GOING TO HAVE A BAD TIME as the game is designed to punish you greatly in every way if you don't join the ward by losing access to areas and resources.

All of this without talking about the bugs and glitches. I suffered from having to lose hours of progress cause an NPC wouldn't show up in the main quest no matter what. I had to reload because the HUD keeps disappearing because you can walk in a swamp and suddenly drown 20 feet down. They excited you with monsters like Chimera only to have an emission every time (is an event where you go underground or you die) which means events are SCRIPTED. Like what happened? Where is the magic of Stalker? What is this lazy beta that feels unfinished, unpolished, and long for the sake of being long (walk those 6KM Skif! WALK!) Add to this memory leaks and optimization that is embarrassing and... wow.

I like the gunplay, is fun and the guns are pretty good, the graphics of them plus the world is beautiful. This game had the making to be decent/good if it was baked for another year or two. Enemy spawns on top of you, enemies never miss a shot even being miles away and mutant AI is a joke, they are dumb. You can jump on a truck or a barrel and mutants will just stay there doing nothing. They are just bullet sponges designed to make you waste ammo (I like psy dog tho). The story is all over the place, with Skif just randomly being treated like the most trustworthy ally and a traitor at the same time. The carry capacity is awful,your choice between being slow and full of ammo or being fast and lacking ammo. 

The OG trilogy is better in every aspect (except graphics) so if you are new you might want to check them instead. Awesome games and can be bundled for almost the same price as this if memory serves right. If you are looking to get into Stalker 2, either wait for more fixes, or go in with the expectation that you are gonna lose progress, you are gonna get bugs and glitches, you are gonna have to reload a LOT, and you are going to have to walk 6 km daily on an atrocious map design. There is a decent game buried here around somewhere, but I couldn't keep up with the chore gameplay to find and chances are, you will not either. The early game is enjoyable, mid game is a chore, late game is suffering.

"Latest update (1.2) fixed [strike]a lot[/strike] [b]some[/b] of the jank, so it's time for a proper review:

UPDATE 2/23: I feel the need to call out some big annoyances I have with the game lately. It's a huge, incredibly fun game, but be prepared to deal with some frustration:
[olist]
[*]Can't pause during the (unskippable) cutscenes. Some of these are quite long, and having to be locked in to my game to find out what happens, while my dog is whining to be let out, is more than a little frustrating. Devs, fix this, it's low-hanging fruit.
[*]Certain mutants can take your weapons and use them against you, which is cool on its own... until those weapons completely disappear even after said mutant is defeated. I hate re-loading a save over stuff like this, but I'll be damned if I lose that unique gun I've been holding onto for half the campaign.
[*]There are still memory leaks that will crash the game.
[/olist]

That said, I'm still enjoying the hell out of the game and the below still applies:

This game is everything I always wanted the original to be. The Zone feels bleak and dangerous, but somehow alive and beautifully detailed at the same time. Anomalies are varied and keep you on your toes. Artifact hunting is a real challenge, but with a good payoff. Using or selling an artifact can be a real tough decision sometimes; it feels well-balanced. Mutants are downright scary.

The weapons system feels very real; guns jam if you don't maintain them, reloading respects whether there's one in the chamber already, ammo is weapon-specific and knowing which guns use the same rounds is genuinely useful. Several kinds of rounds for each as well; armor-piercing, etc... They really put in the effort to flesh this all out, and it shows.

English translation is a little... odd in some places, but it's not too distracting. I will say I miss the accents from the original... The English voice actors mostly have UK or American accents, which is fine, but it breaks the immersion a bit. Might switch to Ukrainian for a second playthrough, and just use English subtitles.

I haven't been this engrossed in a single-player experience in a long time. A proper treat for anyone who's a fan of cold-war-era sci-fi, open-world shooters, or survival horror. Can't wait to see how it ends, then immediately go back for a second helping!",positive
good support,positive
"Great game, a little buggy at times, but generally a very immersive and impressive experience. Recommend playing it in Ukrainian with English subtitles tho, much more authentic that way.",positive
"Pros:
+ very immersive world
+ very large map
+ great cutscenes and character interactions
+ satisfying story and combat

Cons: 
-A-life not working properly
-Enemies frequently spawning close by 
-Economy and weapon durability loss
-Still a bit buggy and some performance issues
-No reward for killing mutants
-Hard stat cap limits even with artifacts (endurance, carry weight, etc)
-Southwest side of the map is a slog to return to town to sell

I really enjoyed my time playing stalker 2 despite some frustrations and I strongly recommend it even in its current state. The story is engaging, and I was not expecting quality cutscenes and interesting characters. This is one of the best immersive games out there, but it’s also a very slow burn. The biggest issue I have with the game is the economy, weapon durability loss and repair prices, which I will explain in more detail below. Another nagging issue is the A-life system, a sys that simulates npcs traveling and fighting each other across the zone regardless of where the player is, is not fully developed the way the devs wanted. They had to make compromises, and this causes enemies to spawn near you every few minutes which after a while can get very tedious, especially when over encumbered and trying to return to town to sell your loot.  There are still some buggy quests and minor bugs and crashes that can overshadow an otherwise very immersive experience; but there is so much great stuff in the game that shines through that it’s easy to look past the rough edges.

Combat

I really enjoyed the gun play and healing in this game, it’s only when fighting mutants that the combat feels unrewarding due to no loot and therefore always loss of equipment durability and resources. But the human enemies are fun to fight. Theres plenty of gun variety and a fully fleshed out weapon/armor upgrade system. 

Economy, equipment durability, repair costs and stat caps

If I could go back and redo my playthrough I would not fuss so much about carrying every sellable gun back to town in the early game, that alone would have saved me 10-20 hrs of playtime in just over encumbered travel time. Guns don’t sell for much in the early game, for example an ak74u or viper will get you about 300-400 coupons (the in-game currency). While in the mid-to-late game after you have advanced the main quest a bit you will be looting better guns off enemies worth far more. So don’t spend too much time in the starter region farming enemies to build up money, the further you get in the main story the better weapons and gear will become available; the main story is long and has quests in almost every region of the zone depending on your choices. 

The reason you might feel like taking everything that isn’t nailed down is because the repairs cost for your equipment is borderline criminal. Thankfully the devs did a few patches that remedy some of the durability loss and repair costs but those changes mostly helped armor while weapon durability loss is still over tuned. For example, I fired a particular good mid game weapon to see how many rounds I could fire from 100 percent durability before I lost 1% durability, and every 3 rounds was one percent. You can easily go through 200+ rounds in just a few fights before returning to town to sell and repair, and some of the locations on the map a very remote and can require 2-3 repair trips back to town before you can finish exploring those areas. And keep in mind 99% of the time I’m firing in semi auto and carefully trying to kill enemies with headshots to conserve ammo and durability, it’s worth noting ammo has weight too and I don’t want to carry a bunch of ammo only to burn through it on full auto and having to run back to town to restock and repair. 

That’s probably the biggest time sink in this game, running back to town to sell your loot to afford repairs on your equipment in order to continue playing. Around the 100-hour mark I started getting tired of the loot sell repair loop and luckily my play style allowed me to retire early with about 450k banked coupons which allowed me to speed run the rest of the game without needing to loot everything and it was very liberating to not have to back track 2-3 times an hour to sell. 
And fyi this was with 140 kg max carry weight via artifacts and armor carry weight upgrades. What’s weird is that in a game with artifacts that can increase things like endurance and carry weight, yet you still have hard caps on those stats even though the max artifact slots any suit can have is 5. Mods will fix this of course but it just makes sense in this world to allow players to use the artifacts they have, to create carry weight build to the max value they can get.  

Loot and rewards and artifacts

This game knows how to reward a player who searches point of interest with a fine-tooth comb. Most of the time you will find something. Not all the loot is exciting, most of the time it’s the necessities: ammo, food, meds, but sometimes you find great stuff like weapon attachments or a new weapon or armor/helmet, blueprint upgrades (for guns or specific armors) or even intel on other stash locations. Almost all of the items have a purpose and practical use, don’t expect tarkov loot where an items’ only purpose is to sell it. 

There is a lot of loot in zone, so much that you shouldn’t head out of town with a ton of supplies. Trust me travel light, you will get plenty of supplies along the way. If you hate dropping loot to stay below the red carry weight threshold this game will frustrate you at times, my advise is find a stash such as a bag or any lootable container and bank it there and mark it on the mark for retrieval later (but don’t use dead bodies as banks, they despawn unless they are a rare static dead body in the world). 
The best loot besides guns and armor is the artifacts themselves, and after every emission the artifact locations you looted will respawn. Some locations on the map have several easy artifact runs that can easily get you 70-100k coupons in about an hr. 

Story and choices
I was very surprised at how much I liked the story and faction decisions in stalker 2. Based on player decisions some town locations will be completely off limits as the enemy faction will kill of sight. This means to experience everything you would need to do multiple playthroughs to see what quests and cutscenes you missed. There are plenty of likeable and interesting characters that help keep the player interested in what’s going on besides just looting and fighting. The game does a very good job at indicating when a major decision is at hand, and some of these choices really impact the rest of the game. The ending you get is based on those major decisions and these endings are pretty in line with what side you choose. 

Performance and bugs

I’m using an intel 10850k, rtx 3080 and 32gb ddr4, installed on a ssd and I consistently get about 80-120 fps at 1440p high settings when out in the wild, but when at towns with lots of npcs I drop down to 30-50 fps. I crashed a dozen plus times in my playthrough and some of the quests required me to reload saves to fix major quest bug, one in particular costing me like 8 hrs of playtime and a legendary artifact. One boss fight was nearly unplayable with massive fps drops into the single digits, but the latest patch 1.2 claims to have addressed it. In general, I played slow enough that a lot of the biggest issues got patched before I encountered them. 

Overall
Stalker 2 is an amazing game if you enjoy immersive style gameplay with plenty of places to go and the player is constantly rewarded for being a thorough explorer. It’s a slow burn, especially at the highest difficulty so it’s not for everyone. I’m really looking forward to the expansion’s and to see this game mature with more A-life improvement’s.

I'm low key annoyed with some of the patches like with the vendor unlimited coupon glitch but other than patching money glitches in a single player game it has amazing fucking potential and I fell in love with the trilogy after completing it with my buddy a few weeks ago. My only concern is content patches and additions to the game overtime. I see them focusing a lot on repairing the game but I feel this game has amazing atmosphere and vast array of artifacts and weapons. Overall i would rate it a solid 8.5 to 9 out of ten for this game only reason it isn't 10 is because of the numerous crashes I've had while trying to play. Good luck GSC World and Slava Ukraine.,positive

"TL;DR: Wait patiently for a sale.  Better yet...wait patiently for the devs to actually make the game playable...at least enough to make the gameplay make sense.   

I had high hopes for this entry, but it's been a rough ride for me.  First, the world feels static and empty and its lack of interactivity is nauseating.  For what appears to want to be an immersive sim, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 is a slog of constant disappointment and endless immersion-breaks.  

A lot can be let go if the gameplay were better, but the dumb AI (what A-LIFE?) of the baddies plus their OP-ness being able to shoot through walls and detect me 100 yards away in the dark while I'm crouched behind cover is too much.  Ok, so ditch stealth and go in guns-blazing you say?  Nope...that's not viable either since enemies spawn constantly right before your eyes like a 1997 rogue-like.  It's terrible. 

The game is janky, static, empty, boring, dated, and the stealth mechanics simply blow at the time of this writing.  If things improve, I will update this review to reflect that.",negative

"Game looks fine but for me at least it seems to be uncooked

- weak stealth mechanic
- weak enemy spawn mechanic
- monsters lack of balance

I wouldn't say it raw but these things should be finished at some point

UPD: I wouldn't recommend it for now because it constantly crashes randomly since its release, and the issue has not yet been fixed.

"They say it had/has bugs, it has inconsistencies in the story, it has unneeded/missing features. It is all true. But this game has what is missing in so many western AAA games nowadays. I has SOUL. It has its own STYLE. So if you are looking for a polished stone - look somewhere else. But if you are looking for a slightly dirty gem - look no further. 

It is also more old-school and similar to the previous STALKERS that you might imagine in 2024/5. So check if you liked previous games. If you did not - likely you will not like this. If you liked them and accepted similar bugs/problems there - you will likely love STALKER 2. 

As for the rest - just try playing e.g. 2h on Steam or on GamePass, the feeling cannot be just described in a review. It is an immersive sim (in this case with dominant component of tactical FPS and exploration). You have to test if it immerses you in particular. If so - bugs will become anomalies, glitches will be special effects, and occasional script problems will be features. All can be explained in the Zone. 

PS. Play with Ukrainian audio, for immersion it is crucial. Also to remind how much the devs had to go though making this game under senseless Russian aggression.",positive
"Patch 1.2 fixed some important issues and I finally finished one iteration of the game! It was really awesome.

"If there’s one thing S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 gets right, it’s the feeling of absolute isolation and danger that defines the Zone. From the moment I stepped into this hauntingly atmospheric world, I knew I was in for something special. The game doesn’t hold your hand, and that’s exactly how it should be.

Exploration is tense and rewarding, with every step feeling like a calculated risk. Mutants lurk in the shadows, anomalies crackle with deadly energy, and the ever-present threat of rival factions keeps you constantly on edge. The AI is ruthless, making combat encounters feel raw and unpredictable. Every bullet counts, and scavenging for supplies is not just encouraged—it’s essential.

Visually, the game is stunning. The ruined landscapes of the Exclusion Zone are dripping with eerie beauty, from abandoned industrial sites to mist-covered forests. Dynamic weather and a day-night cycle add an extra layer of immersion, making even a simple trek across the map feel like a journey into the unknown.

The non-linear storytelling is another highlight. Choices matter, and the world reacts to your actions in ways that feel meaningful. No two playthroughs will be exactly alike, giving S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 the kind of depth that keeps you coming back.

That said, it’s not perfect. Technical issues and occasional performance hiccups can break the immersion, and some bugs might make you grit your teeth. But for those willing to endure a few rough edges, there’s an unforgettable experience waiting here.

S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl is a game that demands patience and rewards perseverance. If you’re looking for a brutal, atmospheric survival shooter that doesn’t compromise its vision, this is it. Welcome back to the Zone, stalker.",positive
"Needs more time in the oven, once everything is smoothed over, this will be a truly special game",positive
"Super enjoyable open world with interesting characters, an intriguing setting, and fun combat - especially now that they’ve fixed the aimbot issues.

I stopped playing a few months ago after getting soft-locked by a zombie with a gun on a tower, picking me off with perfect aim from a kilometer away lol. That problem seems to be fixed now, and the stealth finally works properly. Fighting armed enemies, which used to be an absolute chore, is now fun and tactical while still being a challenge.

I highly recommend this game. Its an achievement that the devs managed to create such an interesting and varied open world despite being in a literal war zone. Just avoid the English dubs-they break immersion quite a lot lol.",positive

And while lots of people will say how inferior of a game this is to the original trilogy or its standalone mods, I don't think that detracts from the core game itself if taken outside of its past.

And while I recommend this game, there are some quirks and things I disliked that would be useful to know:
- Fast travel is limited to between settlements and your only mode of transportation otherwise is walking. 
- Mutant health is waaaaay too tanky. There are mods to adjust this though if you feel it'll help.
- While the game still has issues with sudden stuttering and bugs with some missions, I feel it's at a point now where most of them are either squashed or happens infrequently.
- You will encounter things that can be considered BS (like escaping a bunch of guys shooting at you only to find yourself in a Bloodsucker pit), but honestly, I think that's part of the experience. F5 is going to be your friend for better or worse.",positive

"Just wanna put it out there for everyone to see, but despite what previous reviews say, the game developers just pushed out an insane patch as of writing this and fixed up on a ton of issues that most people addressed. I would give it some time still, but you gotta commend the developers for really pouring their heart out and working around the clock to fix up on what it's community reports on.",positive
"As someone who played and loved the earlier titles, I was unsure Stalker 2 would ever meet my expectations after being in development off and on for 15 years. And honestly? I had a fantastic time playing it. They managed to capture the atmosphere and loneliness of the zone, the weirdness of the characters, while being unafraid to change things. The zone has evolved in 15 years just as we have changed. 

I've played a number of AAA games where the individual systems worked well but the overall experience lacked a central vision, sanding off any interesting edges until you get a slurry of content. Stalker 2 holds true to its roots with an experience that felt directed and intentional. I embodied Skif as he scavenged the zone, trying his best to survive in a brutal world and every interaction reinforced that.

Sure there were the occasional bug, sometimes I had to reload a save to fix it, but nothing compared to when I played Shadow of Chernobyl back in the 2000s. Apparently the patch today fixed a lot of them. Just be sure to quick save often and you'll be fine.",positive

"A totally uncompromising vision of pain and suffering in hardcore shooter form - I love it; feels like we are right back in 2007 here on Steam when we were blessed with the eurojank classic that is the OG Shadow of Chernobyl. 

For those experiencing Stalker 2 without a historical relationship to the series, this game may be hard to digest. Additionally there are a myriad of reasons this game is emotionally complex for many of us at a meta level, not the least of which being real life conflicts surrounding the nation so deeply tied to this series. 

Starkly beautiful and violent, with a high skill ceiling that will allow you to show off your FPS acumen in dramatic fashion, this is a commendable evolution in the series. If you are looking for heavy RPG elements, numerous side quests, crafting and whatnot - best head back to other safe harbors for your taste - this is a more raw experience not burdened by such jetsam. And here’s to hoping Stalker stays that way! (With luck, the devs will resist the pressure to reduce the general difficulty - and so far so good; we got buffs to the various mutants instead of more nerfs!)",positive

In some ways the original game is as good or better (ladders, menus, taunts, and a weapon or two which are either missing or I haven't found yet). Much of the landscape and buildings have been re-purposed for the reprisal, and for my current rig minus Xfi sound card isn't as good, but if you're a Stalker, and you know if you are, this never gets old. Recommend a RTX 4060 or higher card.

This isn't Call of duty or Apex, if u want a rush adrenaline game 24/7, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 isn´t for you. This game is more about the journey than the end goal, is about inmerse yourself in a the zone with, ""grey"" morals and hidden motives.
Yes it has some problems (bugs), but im around 80 hrs in game and discorver a few ones, so far no game breaking bugs for me. The optimization isnt perfect, but i have a 2070 max-q (yes a laptop) and i can run it at 60fps (1080p, with frame gen, and low-mid settings)",positive

"I love GSC, i love Post Apocalyptic culture and games and i mostly liked the game but i wanna be honest here... I do not care if they were on war or not, i payed full price for a product which is not what they promised. So here is my opinion:

CONS:
-The game is not finished, it has many bugs that have to be addressed and yea there are game breaking bugs which will make you use mods to skip missions etc. (I had to use the console mod to bypass a ""boss fight"" because it was stuck in an invisible wall). 
-The worst thing is the Unreal Engine 5, it simply doesn't work in open world games and it will probably never work. There are artifacts in lighting,LOD problems and you have to use frame generation to achieve a playable framerate which increases the input lag so much even on a high end pc. 
-The game also uses TAA which is awful and provides a pretty blury image. 
-CTD issues
-The A-Life aspect for the time being is a gimmick and doesn't work as indented. 
-One of the main gameplay issues is that it needs BALANCING and i mean it. The stamina, the inventory weight and the damage you make at the enemies feels really unrealistic and it makes you angry most of the time. Same thing for the economy of the game...
-Weather system feels really random and unnatural. Idk why but most of my playthrough was at night.
-Stealth feels like sh*t.
-A.I is a joke
-Audio cuts from time to time
-Ukranian voice has no lipsync and English Voice is cringe AF. There is a moment where you meet someone and his accent is Scottish! I mean WTF! Why? I was laughing my ass there....
-Healing system is the same with Far Cry games and Player starving has to be removed, it provides simply nothing to the gameplay, its simply an icon under your health and you have to press E to eat in order to hide, aside from that it does nothing.

PROS:
+AMAZING ATMOSPHERE. Lonely at day, horror at night.
+Chernobyl at its best. They did a really good job with the art direction here.
+Music also fits the game ( would love a portable device in order to be able to play it while free roaming)
+GUNPLAY is sick! Slow,tactical and the guns sound and feel like real guns.
+I really appreciate the fact that they hired the director of Hardcore Henry to do the combat choreography in cutscenes. Its something else! I LOVED THEM!
+I also appreciated that the world is hand crafted, you can obviously spot it in many areas of the game. They do not feel ""generated"", they do not feel ""copy-pasted"" or ""extended"". Every area in the game is unique!

I understand that they couldn't delay it more but i also believe that this game will be ready in a year or so.
It has the potential to be something big and playable. For the time being no i cannot recommend it.
I will definitely replay it sometime in the future and re-review.",negative

"The atmosphere and ambiance is unmatched. Being a big fan of the original trilogy and all the mods, I am objectively biased torward my final opinion of STALKER2. I enjoyed a lot of the side quests, explored every nook and cranny,  stash marker, gathered all artefacts (including legendary ones), all weapons, attachments, armors. After 176 hours I beat my first playthrough.

A lot of major issues have been resolved regarding game crashes and bugs. Some optimizations have been done for widescreen support. The game still is under optimized (I blame UE5) and there are still bugs (ie the short video that plays when teleporting still freezes and audio cuts out after a few seconds). 

Despite these and other flaws I didnt mention, I still love this game and its series. 

Haters are gonna hate over the trivia things that can easily be modded (longer day night + weather cycle, currency earnings and costs, weapon modding, binoculars, night vision). Although I do agree with the suggestions, those are petty reasons to give a bad review. 

Once thing i'd like to see in the future is finding Guides outside of main locations. My main use for a guide is get to a town to trade.

Most area's are reachable with out having to do any questing meaning its an open world for those who just want to loot, shoot and hoard artifacts.

Controls are solid, responsive, and everything you'd want in a shooter unless your a COD player wanting to 180 no scope people sort of dumbness.

Game had quiet a few bugs and performance issues but even my 17 year old potato PC could handle it on medium settings. Big patch just dropped today and im writing this as I wait for it to finish so I could get back out there!

My only complaints really is I wish they'd release the Deluxe and Ultimate editions as upgrades to the base edition and I wish I didn't run out of Stamina so quickly.

"[strike] Game has save breaking bugs that have been known about since before christmas and are still present in February.

The only solution is to go back to an old save but the game deletes old autosaves so if you spend any time doing side missions or finding stashes it will have deleted your autosave from before you could fix the game meaning in my case losing 15 hours of game time.

No word from the devs about this being fixed and any attempt to use console commands to fix it just results in more broken progress.

Review will change as and when/if the devs fix these bugs.[/strike] 

Literally a few hours after I leave this review they released patch 1.2 which did indeed solve the progression breaking bug and allowed me to load my last save and continue the game. 

Considering that was my major contention with the game, and it is otherwise enjoyable I've shifted from negative to positive. If you liked Stalker then Stalker 2 is worth your time.",positive
"Game is still unfinished, game breaking bugs wont allow to progress in the story and finish the game, very slow patching release.

Will be good to buy in steam sale by Xmas 25, not now.

EDIT: After last patch I was able to finish the game, sadly the fact that I need to wait 3 months to finish my play has left me bitter, game is good, maybe a 7.5/10 but limited A-life makes the map empty between quest locations, you get to a quest you have fun blasting human and mutants and now you must run 20 minutes to next location, game will spawn some enemies next to you but as you can't loot mutants and human loot is always broken weapons the best is to continue running and do not waste ammo.

So once again, wait for sale.",negative

"This is another Cyberpunk 2077 situation, though honestly a lot less buggy than 2077 on launch. The game systems just don't feel balanced or like they're in their final form. Currently I've had to stop playing after 46 hours after the main quest trapped me in a room with an NPC that refuses to speak to me. Apparently this is a common issue. 

Still, ignoring the game breaking bug, the game is far from perfectly thought out. I think the carry weight is fine, and I had a lot of fun being very specific with packing my bag before heading out into the zone, but why have a grid-based inventory system if I'm not allowed to organize it myself? Why would you make sprint stamina lower than in the first 3 games when 90% of the game is traveling across flat ground from point A to B?

A lot of the flaws are due to the fact this game was developed during an actual war, so I can give it some slack, but still. The lack of A-Life, the game breaking bugs, the enemies that can see you through bushes and walls, the packs of dogs that are just not as fun to fight as they were in the original, it's just not ready yet.

Which is a shame, because there was always something pulling me back. I wouldn't have played 46 hours if I wasn't having some fun here. Hell, I'd play even more despite the flaws, but I literally can't! I predict this game will be pretty awesome in a few years once its had a few reworks.",negative

"Had a few issues with what I can only assume are memory leaks at the start, frame rate would suddenly drop and stay there - I resolve by making my way back to the main menu, waiting for the frame rate to resolve (watch the guys around the campfire), and then continuing.  Haven't encountered as much since, seemed to be more frequent when messing around with graphics settings.  Also verified install using Steam tool - found an error with file, something I'm now keeping an eye on.

Have already had some of the best firefights I've had in a single-player game, gun-play is satisfying and enemy combatants will push.  So far, a little unfinished - but definitely Stalker, the addiction is rising again.  Keep your kit serviced - it'll jam at the worst possible moment - while frustrating, it's a great part of the game-play mechanic in my opinion, there's a few things like this that add another layer to survival in the zone.  Not just a braindead run & gun.

While I'm running relatively low-spec hardware by 2025 standards (Laptop w/ 3060 Mobile, 11900h, 32GB DDR4...), I have to admit I've not been blown away by the UE5 implementation here.  May invest in a new PC, but not expecting that to give a step change either from what I've seen.

Overall, If new to Stalker - maybe wait a little while and go and play Call of Pripyat or Anomaly; if a stalker die-hard, you've probably already bought this.  I'm a little way in and it feels very familiar, hoping the storyline brings something new, and mods increase replayability.

To the fallen of the zone!",positive
"I love this game. First game in a long time I played trough on hardest difficulty without being bored. I tried to play stalker anomaly etc to find an immersive game but I do fint the crafting, repairing system etc too much for the fun of it. Stalker 2 is more like an arcade version for good and bad. 

I love the atmosphere, the weapons modification system and the quests and sidequests.  

What I would like to see is a more hardcore survival mode , with all of the great gameplay and wishdom from gamma etc. I would like crafting, hideouts and more complex survival mechanism, skill systems, etc etc 

Also something I lacked in the game was a bigger variety of monsters and also the enviroment being more hostile. Now you can just sprint around the map, not worrying being attacked by a bunch of all the awesome mobs that exists in gamma. Its just not scary, even playing on veteran. Also the endgame has only NPCs no super mutated pseudodog with 5 heads that you need to gear up for...

Anyway , all my love to GSC and Ukraine... I will glady buy any DLC to support your work and your contry,

"Unfinished game tbh even bought the ultimate edition out of ´support´, There is also no russian version or language in the game because of political reasons?",negative
"Game is good enough to be a Stalker game but has a ton of issues that I would say don't play this game until massive mod lists come out that overhaul large aspects of the game. I'll kinda start in a list format:
1. Graphical issues are wild, there's this fuzzy outline on any reflection that gets super frustrating to look at when you have a top end rig. Right at the start I spent an hour going through settings while staring at a body of water with reeds around it's perimeter or a tree trying to tune the settings only to realize it's just bad and there's no fixing it..
2. The AI is horrible, it's worse than old stalker games. Enemy's fire like robots with insane accuracy through bushes 200 meters away in the dark. They have zero tactics, they just run in a straight line at you until they die. Very frustrating.
3. They really clung on to a lot of older systems and mechanics that are outdated af from older games. Upgrading firearms doesn't change their appearance at all other than adding sight rails or a compensator. 
4. The weather events are minimal, barely ever occur, and don't feel substantial. When it rains it feels like it's only a light mist, I think it's always cloudy but I cant remember. 
5. The story was soooooo boring, omfg they keep trying to introduce new characters every 10 seconds. I don't remember anyone and every character and faction had seemingly random and non sense motivations. 

Just play Stalker GAMMA instead, it's a free mod of old games that unironically looks better, plays better, and is more interesting. 

Here's a quick list of things the devs should do that will immediately make this game 10x better.
1. Add weapon customization (i.e. stickers, paints, visual modifications when you pay to upgrade a gun)
2. Toss all your voice actors and hire a voice acting agency with actors all from one place, not this mish mash of french, british, and turkish VAs that can barely speak english (I'm sure the Native language pack sounds better, but Im american what can do)
3. Add night vision, add thermal nods, add gun cleaning kits, add a freaking food and water  meter.
4. Make weather a more impactful element of the experience, tweak your rain so that it feels like im in  a storm, add lightning and thunder with impact, add snow events, add hot blazing sunny days, create a better night time skybox with a clear view of the stars sometimes. Play stalker GAMMA to  get a good idea.
5. Add more dialogue with random NPCs. I want to ask more than ""whats new in the zone?""
6. When you pick up  a note or voice memo, make the PDA auto play the thing. I don't want to open my PDA every 5 minutes to read a memo that sometimes I struggle to find in the menu..
7. Add better and more clear identifiers on ammo types
8. create a survival mode with more strict food and water intake requirements. 
9. Fix enemy AI, literally anything is an improvement on what the current state of the game is.
10. Graphical fixes out the ass please. 

I thought waiting a couple months after initial launch would give you guys time to fix stuff, but the games a mess.",negative
"Performance problems aside , This is still one of the worst games i ever played , its just bad
 nothing about it is  immersive .

-99 percent of guns are broken , no idea how the AI is able to use them

- One more patch and we are looking at an entire games worth of  drive space",negative
"A great experience that had me hooked from the start to the end. I was very much invested in the characters and their individual stories. The gunplay felt solid and realistic.

I ended up exploring and adventuring a lot more than i anticipated, it was fun looting, shooting, and solving puzzels while exploring. The Story was also really good, better than I expected. The only down side is a couple of bugs that occurred during my run, which was a couple of key NPCS were missing but other than that it was great.",positive

"In general the game is good for about 15 hours after that it feels like you gotta walk 2km to have a 2 min dialog, then walk back. It just feels like a walking simulator and the performance is mid. I started using speedhack to get from A 2 B bc if you gotta walk 2km after every mission it gets old, i didnt open the game to walk and all of a sudden a giant wall of rocks or mountains is blocking the way (happens really commonly) and I have to get around it before I can continue my way. The AI aimlocks you at a way to far distance overall with to much precise aim, i think i play on hard but thats just straight up bullshit sniping someone through smoke or just trying to shot you through the wall. Weight system is a bit stupid since either youre always overweight or needing to run to the trader/stash all the time wich is mostly far too when youre questing. Fazit: Game is mid, buy it on sale for maybe 15-20€ and enjoy like 15-20h of playtime

However, my computer does not love playing this game",positive
"About 10 years ago, I picked up Stalker C.O.P and after 5hr or so I put it down due to jank and the rough presentation. 3-4 years later I came across a video on a heavily modded version of the Call of Chernobyl mod that combines all of the games. The base mod, in addition to these other mods, greatly increased the presentation and before I knew it, I was hooked. I had hundreds of hours of game play. I fell in love with the atmosphere and vibe of Stalker. It was one of those rare games that didn't make me feel special. I had to work and struggle to survive and I felt like I earned something by doing so. A few years later I came across Stalker Anomaly and lost a couple more hundred hours.

I was so excited but nervous when Stalker 2 was announced. Could it capture the atmosphere and feeling of the mods that I poured hundred of hours into? They had over a decade to do it, I was hopeful.

I bought this game on release, which I haven't done since CP2077 (and that did not pan out). And it pains me, but this game just doesn't connect with me like the previous games. Maybe this is unfair of me because I'm comparing it to mods that hundred of people have contributed to over the last 15 years. Or maybe I'm just getting older. It's just missing something.

The combat doesn't have that weight, there is a great lack of loot variety, the writing is fine but I kinda miss the text boxes (as that is when you got the real lore dumps), the world doesn't feel alive or reactive. It feels like a shallow imitation of the older games with a pretty coat of paint. And it's a pretty coat of paint, don't get me wrong.

This is on top of the performance, bugs, and crashes. I upgraded my PC to play this game (I9, 64gb DDR5, NVMe SSD, I do still only have a 2080) but this game crashes every 30min. For a game that is supposed to be immersive, this is unacceptable.

Maybe I had unfair expectations, but I hope this is helpful for anyone who might come from the same background as me. And that I was unfortunately very disappointed with this game.",negative
"I love the game man but it's too buggy. I love the atmosphere, the world and how cool the artifacts look. Too bad that the cool artifact is stuck in a water tower and I need to install mods to no clip that shit. I love the characters that in this game and the slow build up to people like Faust, BUT i turning schizophrenic because I'm hearing people that are in front of me sounding like they're 12 feet behind me. Long story short, if your willing to put up with BS, buy the game. If you don't want to  deal with the game's nonsense, wait until a year for the patches to fix the game and become the game it truly deserves.",negative

Story is also OMEGA mid. so yeah",negative
"I love this game. I love this series. I have been a diehard fan since SOC and i have defended the jank because the vibes have been immaculate, but there are glaring issues with storylines being soft locked because a door won't unlock.

"Fantastic game... some issues here and there for me, nothing major or unavoidable, maybe others we're so lucky but honestly these days all games feel unfinished and have a lots more issues the this one, coming from bigger names. STALKER tho makes up for any Issues I encountered with the story and the way it feels and keeps me playing it for hours, making it into my top 5 games of all times. LOVE IT.   

Also, it looks like the devs work as hard as possible to make up for any overlooked details or issues... so give them some credit. Lots of love and energy went into this game, I can assure you...  

P.S. The way all the other Stalker stories and maps we're integrated into this one, and completing the story with the Doctor and all others pieces of information and lore you find around by also doing side quests and just exploring makes the game and other games from the series 10 times more worthy of playing.

"[b][h2]S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl, man...  [/h2][/b]

[b]In general:[/b]
It’s hard to say. Graphics? Killer. Audio? Pure atmosphere. The world, characters, mutants—top-notch. But it’s rough. Poor optimization, missing key features the old trilogy nailed. After all this time? I'm disappointed.

[b]Why I'm skeptical:[/b]
The A-Life system feels busted. Enemies spawn too close too often. Lack of audio of fights happening in the distance is misleading, often audio plays when the enemy/fight is just around the corner.. Stealth? Enemies see in the dark and from a far and through foliage. Oftentimes the enemy sees us first than the other way around. Stashes? Copy-paste, nothing special there. Player needs to have a way to pass time outside of the hubs, some extra activities.

[b]Final words:[/b]
I bought it out of love for S.T.A.L.K.E.R., knowing the old games had issues. But back then, GSC was experimenting. Now? After 7–8 years of developement, I expected more -  an ultimate S.T.A.L.K.E.R. experience not experiment.

[b]Right now, the game feels unfinished, unpolished even after all these patches. If you ask me? Wait for a sale, or try the old trilogy + anomaly mod - which literally is an ultimate stalker expirience[/b]

"After putting ~40 hours into my playthrough I had to stop playing... The Zone is beautiful, mysterious, and.... dead. Outside of the Lesser Zone there is little side content to partake in, and much of it is ""go here, snag X, bring back."" 

As for the main story, I was really getting tired of the ""Go here talk to X they will know more,"" and the ""You need to go in this bunker and shut off X/turn on X."" It just started to get repetitive. [Spoiler] The game felt fun and great until SIRCAA, after SIRCAA everything fell off for me. I got to the point where I met the legendary STALKER Strelok and he told me to walk another 4km and that's when I had enough of the game. If I wanted to play a walking sim, I would have played death stranded [/spoiler]. 

My biggest net negative for the game is how tedious and annoying fights with enemies, especially mutants, get in the late game. A A psuedogiant should not take 8ish RPGs to the face and survive. Enemies with exoskeleton suits shouldn't take 5-6 hits with AP ammo to kill, especially in a economy where rarer bullet types are scarce. It felt like I was playing Starfield without enemy HP bars over them.

Right now, I cannot recommend this game.",negative

"I put in more than a 190 hours and finished the story up until the very last of the ending missions. Pretty entitled to an opinion, I'd say. It's simple: don't buy this, don't do what I did and save your precious time.

This game will never be fixed because you can't fix what's not there. There are about three sidequests in all regions past the first three regions. You will notice that all the main missions after that are the same lab crawls with only exosuit enemies and/or a mutant at the end. So even if you forget the endless bugs, softlocks, necessary modifications to INI-files for performance and downloaded mods to fix other things, it is a massive disappointment. 

You can laugh at my hours, but you won't be laughing after the last three quarters of the game commences. 

I can't put it any better than this: the game will never be fixed and this company sold you a quarter of a game by filling the first three regions with decent content and more than a dozen others with nothing. The ending missions don't even pretend that the game is completely unfinished, teleporting you from conversation to conversation, after which you get to play Unreal Tournament vs respawning bots and dumb Deus Ex-like boss battles.

The stalker fanfiction of a story didn't help either. Look at my achievements and playtime for proof.

2) Constant pre loading of shaders
3)Elements, textures, interactables in one more or another fail to load properly.

Basically when I arrive everything looks like ps1 graphics, then after some major pop in i get teleported to a random room in the sawmill where there are 3 NPC's, one of them is named ""Mute"". I cannot interact with any of them outside of asking ""whats new in the zone?""

While i could forgive technical issues due to the development history, i cannot forgive how it systematically destroys the lore and world of Stalker. The story is a mess, the world is empty and mostly auto-generated. The locations from the original trilogy are only there for the trailers and most of them are empty and serve no purpose, most oft them have been notably pushed to the side of the map like assets that are unused. The map itself does not make sense in general, chaning the order of the locations in a way that does not work with the original story, without a notable reason. Characters from the original games have nothing in common with the original trilogy except the names, they return solely to (who would have guessed) be shown in the trailers. There is almost nothing new, no new mutants, weapons, enemies, notable locations, mechanics. And the few things that are new are horrendously bad (just look up the flashbang anomaly).",negative

"What can I say after 90 hours spent in the Zone... It's a well-crafted sequel that hopefully will be patched.

'Stalker 2' was anticipated for years after the 'Call of Pripyat' release. Like the in-game Zone, it has 2 sides: the good one and the bad one. Powered by Unreal Engine, the Zone looks just magnificent. However, don't be fooled by its look, as bugs and FPS drop hide like chimeras in the night. The game requires a powerful CPU rather than a GPU. Worth saying, that a recent patch (1.1.4) made things better, but there's much work to do yet.

Weapons and shooting here: my pleasure. A comfortable impact, you can feel the weapon. But, the damage system's strange: the higher the difficulty, the more damage you should inflict to kill your enemies. Enemies are tougher and hit you more in return. Higher difficulties aren't recommended at the moment.

The Zone's huge, yeah, go wherever you want (almost), but it might take a while to get there in real-time; besides, sometimes you'll face 'soft locks' left by the devs where you can't simply pass on another location (like snipers' bullets or deadly radiation level) till the proper moment.

Economy's broken a bit and reminds 'Clear Sky' a bit. You won't have a fortune fast like you probably had in 'Call of Pripyat'. Still, repairs cost a lot, especially high-end gear and closer to end. I'd fix that.

A-Life: it's cut at the moment, you'll face countless enemy spawns around you, and one moment it starts to annoy. Get used to it for a while, that's a hard pill to swallow.

Artifacts: meet the old ones, find the new ones. I'd improve rare artifacts generation, as I managed to find 3 rare thermo artifacts, while I wasn't so lucky with others.

The plot's OK, don't expect something extraordinary. Most of the core characters have already been shown. The protagonist's reason to enter the Zone didn't resonate with me too much, I'd prefer a 'memory issue' start as it was with Strelok on 'Shadow of Chernobyl'. IDK if the leak's the reason for it. Anyway, it's curious to see where the road leads based on your actions.

Also faced the following issues (besides FPS drops): quest bugs (1 main story, the mark didn't disappear – not critical; 2 side quests, where in 1 case I had to leave the location to finish the quest (annoying a bit), and in the 2nd case – the NPC simply didn't spawn where it was needed, so I had to finish it in a bloodbath (I'd consider this bug as a critical); mouse issues (cursor appeared a few times, restarted PC to fix that).

Despite some bugs (or should I say 'anomalies), I enjoyed the game. Was worth waiting. A minute of silence for those who didn't make it to play it. 

Look forward to the bright future with patches coming ahead and DLCs on horizon! Stay strong, and...вдалого полювання, сталкере.",positive
" Doesn't feel like the stalker games I know, but I hope one day it is.. The bugs, ai, graphics, interactions, voice-lines, and mutants feel artificial and lifeless compared to  clear sky or COP.. If you dont care for small details from the old games thats okay. The small details mean alot and the way the A-Life system functions, Mutant/npc interactions and THE PDA are so dumb down from its predecessor. It worries me about the future but i hope they buckle down and deliver what was promised",negative
"Yes there are a few bugs, but honestly nothing too major from my own experience. Great vibes, satisfying gameplay, interesting story line. I've been having a great time just wondering around the Zone enjoying the ambience. People saying the game feels empty might have unrealistic expectations - I'm over 100 hours in and still finding myself engaged and interested despite only being (I think) in the mid game. That seems like a pretty reasonable amount of play time from a single player campaign. 

Truly a worthy successor to the first Stalker trilogy, and I have high hopes for further DLC and the eventual Gammafication of it!",positive
"[h1][b] STALKER 2 from the eyes of an outsider, who loves hardcore games, like Tarkov. [/b][/h1]

TL;DR: After more than 10 years in development hell, engine changes and a literal war, STALKER 2 releases in a playable, yet not enjoyable, buggy state. Imagine Fallout 4 without its weapon crafting and without it's satisfying quest and enemies rewards, in exchange for better cutscenes and slightly better writing, set in a blurry world, thanks to the poorly implemented always on ray tracing. It's without a doubt a game made with passion, both from the devs and for the long standing fans who waited so long for a sequel, but after all the hurdles this game went through, personally, I think it just hasn't really hit it's mark. The only thing left for the fans are the constant updates, and mods. If you're on the fence about buying this game, you may want to look at other options, like the Metro series.

[h3][b] Gameplay loop [/b][/h3]
STALKER 2 plays exactly like a Fallout game. You get out of your starting point with a marker on your compass, as you progress towards that marker, you hear some shots, or loot a specific note, and you're pointed towards a side quest. You can find different weapons and armor, improve them by fitting matching attachments, and juggle them in your inventory, limited solely by weight. You can loot various containers to find ammo, cash, bandages and food. 

Survival elements are also present, those are stamina, fatigue (need to sleep), hunger, hydration and radiation. You can treat all of those by using their related items, which you can find as loot or in vendors.

The game also revolves around anomalies in the world, which messes with the world physics and living beings, they are visually interesting, but when you look at them closely they are just glorified obstacles that do the same thing: damage the player and prevent passage, nothing else.

[h3][b] Combat Problems [/b][/h3]
The combat against humans in this game is excellent, they are much more aggressive than the average game, who usually makes the enemy behave like prey. The human enemies in STALKER 2 rely a lot on flanking to surround the player, accompanied by heavy use of grenades, which are not shown on the game's interface, but instead greatly telegraphed by call outs from enemies or by hearing the distinctive clicks of the pin releasing or the grenade rolling on the floor. Headshots also insta-kills if the enemy is unarmored, rewarding the players with a clear death, thanks to the good sound design.

The problem here relies on the mutant enemies. They are dumb, bullet spongy creatures that drops no useful or remarkable loot. If you've ever played Metro: Last Light, you probably know the sections where the game just throws a bunch of enemies, just to make you waste ammo, without rewarding you in any way other than progressing through the level.

In some more extreme cases, like with Bloodsuckers and Poltergeists, it's difficult to even judge if you're dealing damage to the enemy, or close to killing it, because the game doesn't provide you with visual or sound cues (other than generic grunting) that the enemy is about to die. 

Their combat behavior is nothing to be impressed about, it's just run at the player, attack, flee, and repeat.

It's so unrewarding and unnecessary to kill the mutant enemies, that at some point I was wondering like ""why bother"", if I can just walk past them, tank their hits with my stims and just go to the next room where the loot was. 

[h3][b] Faction Design Flaws [/b][/h3]
Whenever you play a game that features factions, chances are that you can spot each faction in a blink of an eye after a short introduction. This doesn't happen in STALKER 2, at least not for me. If google serves me right, there are 12 factions in the game, and I can probably spot easily just 3. The other faction members, I found roaming around aimlessly in the zone, in generic armor or rags, saying ""talk to our boss at our base"", which I took a look at the PDA and around me, and found nothing but trees. There was no option to ask for directions or ask who they were or what they do, you literally have no idea of who most of them are and consequently have no interest in dealing with them, since they look so generic. In contrast, I'm sure many people were jumping out of their seats once they saw the Paladins walking in power armors in Fallout, or the Vampires when playing Skyrim. I understand STALKER is supposed to be semi realistic, and factions doesn't need to be a bunch of power rangers, but come on, give us players a proper introduction to the factions like the game did with the Ward, SIRCAA or Spark. 

This problem becomes even more alarming in the later quests, where a shootout begins and you have no idea who's on you side and who's the enemy.

[h3][b] Story Pitfalls (no spoilers) [/b][/h3]
As I stated before, I've never player any other STALKER game, but from what I know, it is NOT an apocalyptic world, it's like our world but with deeply cursed exclusion zone of Chernobyl, where a bunch of lunatics go searching for artifacts to make a fortune. With this is mind, our protagonist, after losing his entire home to an artifact that appeared outside of the Zone, decided it was a great idea to risk his life by venturing into the zone. Like seriously, could you not phone a friend asking to crash at his place or something like that? That whole premise is just mind blowing. Sure the player found a unique artifact that's even more valuable than most, but as soon as things start to go wrong at the prologue of the game, the character is just unphased by everything happening in the zone, despite being new to it, it was really off putting. Take Far Cry 3 as a good example of a protagonist who's suddenly forced into a new reality, and slowly gets acquainted with it, eventually turning into a lunatic worthy of the place he's now in.

And this is just the beginning, as I progressed through the game, I felt like there was major plot points or quests that could not be finished in time, which left a rushed impression on me that made me not want to finish the game, since I was VERY lost at the game near the end. 

The protagonist did not seem to judge his actions at any moment, he felt exactly like a game character, just going from one point to the other.

To end this section, some of the quests are exclusive to one another, and the game doesn't tell you this, which can lead you to take wrong decisions when you just though you were going to check out a place or have a talk with someone, forcing you to reload a save.

[h3][b] Graphics: A Radioactive Blur [/b][/h3]
Always on ray tracing in 2024 in a open world game. Do I need to say more? This is going to be a DLSS (or worse yet, FidelityFX) powered game, resulting in unclear backdrops, shimmering like never before and noise everywhere. The game sure looks good on a still frame, but this is a video game, not a painting, and it looks and plays bad because of this decision, which I'm sure is all thanks to the challenging development cycle the studio had to go through.

--- 

So yeah, that was STALKER 2 for me. I got frustrated out of the game, I really wanted to like this game since I got it as a gift from my loving girlfriend and heavily endorsed by a close friend, but I couldn't do it. Maybe I'll check back later when the multiplayer comes out.",negative
"The English voice acting was so bad, I just prevented me from getting into the game. I switched it to Ukrainian and just read the text (in English). This is much better for me.  The premise seems interesting, and I am a sucker for RPG's with guns, just getting going.",positive
"Game is visually pretty good but plays like ass. Hit boxes on enemies are absolute shit, Iron sights on guns don't line up with where your actually shooting. Game will randomly have frame rate drops usually at the worst possible time like during combat. Sensitivity for mouse is whack. As of now I don't recommend this game. Who knows maybe they'll eventually fix it.",negative

I needed to download a mod to access the dev console just to progress the story, but i  was willing to do so because of how much i enjoyed the game. I adore this game, just not in this state, please wait for them to further iron out the creases because once they do, itll be incredible",negative
"Huge downgrade in terms of mechanics and gameplay of earlier games.

Poorly optimized and not very fun. Refunded. The older games are better.,negative
"The opening hours are pretty good, sadly the more you advance  and move into the later areas, the more you’ll realize how rushed and unfinished the game is.",negative
"This has the potential to be an all time classic one day. However, that day is not today. There are a many game breaking bugs still in the game months after the game has released. At first the Dev team was on fire with the patches but soon after the upkeep fell completely off. I have been playing the game in the Veteran difficulty and have about 100 hours in and here are my findings.

The game has many many guns and armor sets and you would love to upgrade them all and try them all out but unfortunately everything is so expensive to upgrade / repair that 90% of gear in the game you will never have the chance to fully upgrade and use.

When artifact hunting some areas spawn artifacts below ground and you can never get to them, known bugs from day one. 

When venturing out in the zone you have random group of 5+ enemies spawn 20 feet from you out of nowhere. 

The inventory and stash management is terrible, there is no search function and you can't expand the little baby window that was designed for a 12"" monitor or something. 

Half the game is just you walking around weighed down barely moving. This is a looting game but yet you can barely hold anything on you. 

Human enemies that spawn have crazy aim while on a full sprint being able to hit you dead on with a shotgun buckshot from 200 meters away, ridiculous. 

Physical objects like shipping container, concrete barriers, train cars are unable to stop any bullets, seems that the mesh for objects has not been coded in at all. 

Stepping in water is like going into quicksand, unable to move at all.

Shooting enemies in the head still takes like 5 armor piercing 5.56 rounds to bring them down, makes no sense at all. 

While doing quests you will get randomly locked into a status ailment like Psi delusions and they will never stop and you can not clear them, the only way to get them to go away is to roll back your saved file to hours earlier and try again. 

The performance of the game is bad, everything is either blurry or completely jagged and flickering, and this is on a 4080 super with a i9 processor. Optimization was an afterthought and might take years before it gets another full pass or two through the game. 

As someone who has played all the Stalker games, it was always left to the community to continue providing unofficial patches to fix the many issues these games have. I really hope that this will not be the case for this game. For now i will let the negative review stand, if the devs decide to wake up and make significant changes to the game i will adjust my review accordingly.",negative
"performance is at unplayable state for an fps. cant get above 47fps no mather what i do, on a 3080.
would refund but believe in and support the devs.",negative
"Bad game with a ""protagonist"" no more entertaining than a burnt piece of toast with zero memorable qualities. Even after struggling to pay attention to the story it was dull and far from engaging. 
As of last checking, this game has just under five thousand players on Steam. Such a low number can speak volumes and I havent even mentioned any bugs yet.. :D 

The community is so clearly split between players encountering bugs against players who encountered none. The majorities are too loud to ignore and its clear the game was in some sort of ""unfinished state' upon release. 
Its quite jank and the AI is dumber than a rock. 

Your call really...I hated this mess",negative

Thank god the protag has the liver of a horse otherwise I would've died of alcohol poisoning 100 times over.,positive
"The game is woefully unfinished. During the early parts of the game, things seem mostly fine. Most of the polish and actual game content is front-loaded to give a favorable initial impression. But as you progress through the story, it becomes clear that the game was released in a very half-baked state. 

Quests are few and far between. The world feels empty and devoid of content. The NPC AI is broken and a far cry from the A-Life system debuted in Shadow of Chornobyl nearly two decades ago (!). This makes gunfights immensely frustrating. NPC encounters feel like the game just teleports enemies 50 meters away from you (because it does), and enemies are near-omniscient and make any feeling of ""fairness"" in combat completely disappear. Performance is atrocious, and crashes are frequent. There are numerous game-breaking bugs that result in players being permanently locked from progressing the story.

This is simply unacceptable for a AAA-priced game. It's abundantly clear that the game needed at least another 1-2 years in development. The current state of the game feels like an Early Access beta, disguised as a finished product. It is clear that many, many other players share my sentiment.",negative
I have finished game 2 times already and it was amazing experience! On first half of my playthrough fps was low even on medium settings(RTX 4070 super) but I didn't see many bugs. After patches my game can run on high settings smoothly with 120-150 fps in rostok. I really liked the story and it was interesting exploring map! Of course there is many things to upgrade and balance but overall the game is great.Also I hope that there will be more side quests in future dlcs,positive
"Very good game, the story is amazing and the gameplay is really enjoyable. There is only one big problem: some mission are VERY bugged and sometimes is really hard to work around the bugs",positive
"The biggest disappointment of 2024.I won't talk about the optimization, which is terrible, but if we ignore that the game is still not good, it is an unworthy successor to stalker 1. I already suspected it, when a game suffers so many delays and you see so few things it is always for a reason. The story is dull and empty, the world feels done without desire.

Bug has been reported months ago, but it is still not fixed. Was this game tested at all? how do you get bug on main quest that completely locks you out. Very unfortunate because other than that it would be my top 10 games ever played.

Incredible world you can get lost in with a rich storytelling experience wherever you go. Highly essential!,positive
"Honestly saying - I'm so tired of these kind of trash developers, who sells their unfinished lagging product for full price. This game is still in Alpha or Beta version, with a lot of graphical and physics ""artifacts"". They have conscience of selling this product for 60 eur? It's the same if a customer will pay me full price for the car service, but his car after my service will be still broken and not able to drive. The customer will punch me in the face - same thing I want to do with these developers. The Game is NOT READY at all! And I hope that in the future these develops who releases their product totally unfinished - will be punished by law. I really love the atmosphere and definitely this game is really great - but ffs, finish it technically first before the release.",negative
"It's fun but there are two sorely missed features from every previous installment.

-Night vision (stop making me fight in the dark with the worlds okayest flashlight)
-Character stats on the inventory screen (how am I supposed to tell what combinations of armor and artifacts are providing optimal performance.

I imagine the dev's or modders will remedy this eventually but in the mean time those features are sorely missed.",positive
"""You can't criticize the game if you have 100 hours.""

95 of those 100 hours is spent walking in between objectives with nothing going on, except the occasional randomly spawned enemies that cannot be visually distinguished from friendly NPCs and will always spot you before you spot them.

The developers focused all of their efforts in the starting areas and the later areas appear unpolished/unfinished.",negative
"Good game but needs a little more time to cook and patches are coming slow.

Don't buy now if you want the finished experience.",positive
"This game has a lot of problems, some say that the zone being empty is not a problem and I agree, feeling alone in a big zone, that’s pretty cool. The problem is the lack of feelings I got from the old games. The zone felt alive, and as much as it was alive, you were a part of it, an insignificant speck of human flesh who didn’t matter at all. In stalker 2, people spawn out of nowhere, the animals have some improvements (you go high, they hide) but that’s about it, there is no way to know if the person you are looking at is from a faction or another unless you get so close they start shooting at you, unless they already started shooting at you, 3 kilometres away and through a full forest. The anomalies have been improved, now the bolts actually help traverse the zone  since they take a little bit of time to activate again.
Back to the main topic: the zone being empty makes no sense, especially since the game is set years after the last games, in a world where it’s fully know that there are artifacts, and MONOLITH IS NOT AROUND ANYMORE. So the zone brimming with life makes sense, except there is no one around and no one needs anything, like what??? I liked the random events here and there, would have loved for them to be randomly generated and more common, especially from the mid game on. Duty doesn’t ask for help killing mutants. Freedom doesn’t ask you to smuggle drugs around. For some reason there are mercenary death squads going around the zone killing on sight, for no real reason. The old military goes around the zone killing on sight, for no reason, no story, nothing. Like, if you take away the main story, which I’m liking… there isn’t much else, the characters aren’t memorable except for a few exceptions. 
I don’t know. I’m hoping for mods in the future that make this stalker 2 what it was supposed to be.",positive
This game should have the early access tag. Interpreted that as you please.,negative
"Buggy, a mess and no fun at all.. Want to play it, but just can't...",negative
terrible optimization terrible gameplay terrible story,negative
"After 72 hours I will say: this game is fantastic, BUT:
-the AI is unreal accurate, not reminiscent of the trilogy whatsoever, with the exception of the grenade throws (I shouldn't be getting beamed by a M860 shotgun across a lake 100m away, like the SG was an AR)
-Enemy AI breaks immersion spawning them 30-40m away from your position inorganically after just looking in that direction (A-Life 2.0 needs to actually be working guys, this is not like the Trilogy)
-Increased durability of SMG's (I shred through durability on these, in comparison to every other class of weapon)
There have also been several instances where quests become glitched or completely soft-locked, and the only way around this has been the load of a previous save or using UETools. The game is still very fun, but man these reasons really start to gnaw at you as you progress through the game. It's not enough to make me stop playing but really hope these issues become addressed soon. It definitely breaks immersion.
EDIT AFTER PATCH 1.2: Running like a dream, AI is fixed in combat, no getting beamed, spawning is MUCH better, feels organic.. (night and day difference in every aspect)
I haven't had that much time with the new patch, but from what I was playing, this is shaping up to be a nice successor to the trilogy, as long as they continue to work on it. Wish it was like this when I bought it! Lol but just an excuse for another playthrough.

Graphics is super fucking nice its realism
The combat is great is as if you get shot IRL and one round hits your head your donzo apart from a few odds and ends

Overall game has some bugs to it and id give it a 7/10

"Still not finished the story, but what can I say after playing around 50 hours? Well, I'll just make a list of what I liked and disliked so far. Because I doubt the ending will magically change my mind. All in all I find it rather tedious to play, even though first game was one of my all time favorite post-apocalyptic games. If you are fine with stuff below then go for it, otherwise I don't recommend this without more updates.

[ Positive stuff ]
Seamless open world map with locations from previous games.
Good character detail, world detail, weapon detail, animations.
Iconic sounds from previous games for that nostalgic feeling.
Majority of mutants cut from previous games are in this game.
Eating, drinking, healing, gun jamming, knock down animations.
Detailed map through PDA with objectives and custom markers.
Camp songs from previous games, ability to play guitar in game.
Ability to sit at the campfire, even though can't eat, drink, chat.
Good environments for exploration, with occasional good loot.
Beautiful when weather is sunny, which is maybe 10 minutes a day.
Good weather system with wind, thunderstorms, lighting strikes.
Actual women in the zone this time, be it vendors but even so.

[ Negative stuff ]
Story is not that engaging, similar to old games.
Performance is actually terrible, with stutters on SSD.
RTX4080 can't hold 60 on 1080p, on epic settings, with DLSS.
Really bad flashlight with majority of the game in dark areas.
Little to no sunny or clear sky weather, a lot of brown and grey.
Day / night cycle is way too quick, it's dark 80% of the time.
Enemies are spawned in close proximity, or literally behind you.
Two groups of NPC's spawn in to fight each other as you roam around.
No radar, no stalker squads on map, no PDA chat, no PDA encyclopedia.
Literally no way to identify NPC's friend from foe, or even what faction.
Sadly no ability to join factions or faction warfare like you can in Clear Sky.
No binoculars, can't tag enemies, yet enemies always see and can hit you.
Enemies see through tall grass, walls, floors, bushes even in pitch black.
Stalkers aimbot with shotguns, pistols hundred meters away from you.
Shooting with silenced Vintorez, instantly alerts all enemies to you.
Stealth!? There's no stealth that I found, couldn't even do melee take downs.
Weapons have butter aiming, constantly sliding all over the place.
Mutants hide from you if you jump on car and they can't get to you!?
Due to mostly gloomy weather hard to enjoy beautiful environments.
A lot of running and not enough guides to travel locations, very bad.
Not enough places to take cover from emissions, when on loot runs.
Numerous places with instant fatal radiation, no time to even react.
Rather boring looking anomalies and effects compared to old.
Immersion breaking english voice over, little to no cheeki breeki accents.
Most stashes aren't worth the travel, you get more loot from enemies.
There are bunch of vehicles in game but can't drive any of them.",negative
"Didn't have the best optimisation when i bought it, then they released a patch which for some reason forced me to have to re download the over 100gb file again, i don't have the patience for that crap, I'll come back to this game in about a year probably, its a good game, but way to screw up the launch",negative
cool game and worth the cost,positive
"There is give and take here. The environment and setting don't disappoint. But the NPC interactions are lackluster and the combat system is absolutely dreadful. Enemies detect you a mile out before you're even aware of their presence and blast you through foliage to where you can't see them, but they never miss. It's like fighting an NPC with full cheat mode aim bot. You have to eat a shot or two and be able to get sighted in on them quick enough with a head shot or blast them on a blind corner with a shotgun. It also has many many performance issues. So I think it's gonna be a ""does not recommend"" for now until they get a good patch in. This first patch was not sufficient.",negative
I love stalker but stalker 2 kinda runs like poopoo and the choice of engine (Unreal Engine 5) makes it look like every other modern ue5 game and is just a massive disappointment.,negative

There is a little bit of jank, but nothing that distracts much or detracts from the experience.",positive
"Yes with some quality of life mods and and console commands, lots of debugging and loading saves it works. In my opinion the game needed test releasing for a year, because that is the level of bugs you will encounter. Similar to Cyberpunk in that regard.

EDIT: PATCH 1.2 REVIEW, yeah its still terrible now just crashes to desktop",negative
"Filled my thirst for post apocalyptic world playthrough. Story is good. World is beautiful, amazing graphics. Smooth gameplay. Had 0 crashes. Having said that, I don't think I will ever replay it. Because I really liked the setting I pushed through the game.

I think you should wait for this to be fixed to really enjoy the game:

1.Dark rooms / night / how far torch and how it works. Walking into a room makes it pitch black. They probably have really good battery technology because I had that torch ON just all the time. 
2. Who ever is shooting at you is a shotgun sniper regardless of the distance. I am pretty sure only player can bleed, from anything. 
3. Too few enjoyable gun fights. Sniper weapon is kind of useless for it's range, because enemies will pop in. 
4. Talking about popping in. -Clear the are, kill a bunch of mutants, die or whatever, load the game again - boom enemies are back. Really not great especialy in the early game when guns are all broken already and ammo is really short.
5. Ammo, sausage and bread and granades and RPGs and medkits and vodka. - Waaaay too much of it just in every single corner. And found maybe 6 rockets for RPGs but due to their weight never got to use them, and there isn't realy an enemy to use it on. 
6. Weapons to use on enemies. Well, early game you don't have weapons to headshot everyone, then when you do have ALL the weapons enemies wear very very thich armored helmes and only most powerfull snipers can one-shot them, otherwise you must play close-range to be able to execute quick and accurate few shot headshots. If you will shoot at the body - half of a clip. 
7. Enemies, in a few spots of open world and main quest areas would just pop in and you can head-shot, another one pops-in etc... Go pick up the loot turn around and they started poping in around the corner. In one area it never stopped. (And no I was not under PSI delusion:)
8. Loot, the weight and stuff system just not well balanced. It's clucky and I like that it adds layer of challenge with that. 

- Very bight and bright side is that modding community is huge and there were lots of amazing QoL mods from day one. 

I would advise to wait until DLC comes out and maybe then give it a go. Having said that - doesn't mean you can't buy it now and support people who made this happen during a WAR, simply unbelievable. When I finished the game and credits started rolling... spoiler alert I guess... there were crosses next to their name, as they lost their lives due to war while making the game... that I really enjoyed actually when I think about it. This game deserves appreciation in a special way if you think about it.",positive
The game has been out for months and bugs that were on launch are still present. Got to the mission (Back to the slag heap) and the mission is bugged and I cant progress the main story hours into the game. All the time i spent playing is a loss since the game is over at this point. Its a stunning game but its lazy that big bugs that are game breaking to the actual main story are still there from day one.,negative
"Glitches or anomalies? The first Stalker had this conundrum. The developers were a bunch of kids back then, but their zeal and attention to detail really shined through to make us patient for the game's gradual maturity. This game has that same feel, but in a much larger and beautiful scale. I have high hopes that GSC will come through, eventually. I've resigned myself to exploring every nook, trying different load outs for excursions, doing small errands, collecting money, enjoying the bugs, workarounds, and glitches as much, if not more, as I would enjoy the game if it had been flawless. One thing is for sure. There will be some of us who will look upon these glitchy times with fondness and stories of our 'solutions'.",positive
"The bones are good, but if you can't complete the game, what's the point? Broken to the core. Messaged the Devs to try and find support and nothing. ""We understand it doesn't work"" but no corrective answers. I wanted so badly to like this game and can't.",negative
"so good
",positive
"Good game so far, so badly optimised its unbelievable and my god is the faust fight just awful, bruh why are you spawning 7 guys on me that spam grenade none stop, when I have a sniper that because its so badly optimised I can't hit anything. Psuedogiant is way too OP, infinite sprint, spams attack that knocks you on to the ground, never gives any time to reload, attacks are not telegraphed at all. ",negative
 game is amazing . . . . .. but my new pc 3500 bills ......... and it crash every 20 min saldy idk what todo.,positive
"Great game with amazing atmosphere and tension. 

Pros:
There is this sense of gloominess and impending doom at every corner. The game makes you suffer for every encounter you take. It is hard but very rewarding.
Great deal of weapons and certain amount of customization. 
The different regions are interesting

Cons:
There is still a lot of jank. 
Can still feel buggy
Some areas lack side quests and a sense of reward for players investigating those regions 
The different factions don't feel too embedded in the game ( Duty, Malachite,Freedom), the only important ones are Noontide, Ward and Scar.

nonetheless I do recommend this game very much
",positive
"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNTIL THEY FIX IT. The Game looks like GRANULAR SHIT without DLSS/FSR, which is completely unacceptable. It gets horrible frames (30-45) on my 2080Ti at 1440P, playing with everything on Low, Med, or High, doesn't make an ounce of difference. A-Life is a shell of its former self. No new game, under any circumstance, should require DLSS to run on a mid-tier and up card. DLSS should be used to COMPLEMENT the visuals. I love the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series to death, and I understand they're in war, but this is complete non-sense. I'd have rather had the entire new game made on their old 2010s engine than this UE5 crap. It's a shame it took me so long to figure out how to get the game get past shader compile, since I only have about 12hr of actual play-time and the rest is trying to get it to run. I should have just gave up and refunded a long time ago. Learn from my mistakes, unless they fix nearly everything about this game, it isn't worth a dime.",negative
"Probably just echoing the thoughts of many players... it's unfinished. So many bugs, including game-breaking ones on the main quest line. Obvious lack of content as well.

absolute cinema,positive
"A depressing amount of bugs, clunk, and lack of content. Severely underdeveloped and released prematurely. This game really does capture the atmosphere of the original games! It is even better now and more immersive with photo-realistic modern graphics technology. This unfortunately comes at a cost because this game does not run well right now and has performance issues on most hardware. DLSS or FSR + Frame Generation is required. This unfortunately will increase the input latency to the absolute worst I have ever experienced in any AAA game but thankfully there is a mod that can fix that. The thing is though I should NOT have to install a mod to make a game work properly out of the box. That itself is disgusting and I'm genuinely baffled they released it like that. 

The A-Life 2.0 system that was promised during development is broken and unfinished at the time of writing this review. In the old games, events such as shootouts between NPCs were simulated ""offline"" in the background as you played, even if they are not in your area because all NPCs and their schedules were loaded in when the game booted up. This gave a great illusion of an alive world with the possibility of the player stumbling across the aftermath of said event during their exploration of The Zone. This does not happen in Stalker 2 and NPCs only exist within the players render bubble (100m). They will walk from point A to point B, then once they reach point B and they are outside your 100m bubble, they despawn. Enemy NPCs are dumb, copy/pasted coding and behaviors, are not unique and don't have any kind of special actions they can perform compared to the first games legendary A-Life systems that were developed 20 years ago. Seriously, look up a comparison video of the old and new A-Life systems on YouTube. 

One thing I did find immersion breaking is that pretty much every enemy has medkits. You will end up looting so many that you are essentially invincible. I had to purposefully limit my meds to give myself an actual challenge in this game. 

The game has an amazing foundation but seriously needs to be finished and have major systems reworked in the next year or so. I am crossing my fingers hoping for a Cyberpunk 2077 Update 2.0 situation to breathe life into this game and revive peoples excitement for the amazing S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series.

For now I regret to say that I cannot recommend this game. I still support the developers, they genuinely do love and care about this franchise, so I have hope for the future. The game is just flat out unfinished.",negative
"I love the bleak atmoshpere. There's something horrifying and beautiful about the zone. It's the kind of vibe i wish was more present in fallout.

Combat against human enemies is frustrating. Line of sight does not function for enemies the same way as it does for me. While my sight can be affected by light, shadows, trees, bushes, and movement, the opponents do not seem to have these limitations. This often leads to my character being shot at in almost any circumstance where im not in cover. Im specifically talking about situations where combat had already begun. Enemies are very accurate with their shots and ESPECIALLY with grenades. They do not seem to run out of grenades or ammo. Enemies with aimbots feels cheesy, but i dont have a better solution for a fun combat scenario. 

Monster enemies drop no loot. I avoid any monster encounter outside of story related quests. If this is intentional design, im not a fan. In the best case, engaging monsters costs ammo and weapon durability. Worst case adds consumables and armor durability. It is a net loss, and i feel foolish after spending any time engaging that type of opponent.

Traversing the open world is boring as shit.

Not all equipment can be modified by all techinicans (npc crafters and repairers aka fucking nerds). I dont see how this is better than being able to repair and modify whatever i have at any technician. 

When isolated, my issues with the game seem like minor annoyances. When combined, these problems really ate away at my enjoyment like a hungry hungry hippo.

The artifacts are just defensive stat modifiers at the cost of radiation. Cool concept of temporary fantastical abilites wasted with boring stats. I aquired appx 10-15 artifacts with different effects. i had a blast (literally in some cases) hunting for artifacts only to be met with a disappointing payoff time and again.

Broken quests really nailed the casket shut for me, requiring reloads to past saves. The time wasted in this manner ranged from several minutes to several hours. The most recent several hour waste of time was my ""quit"" moment.

Side note: This may be specific to my hardware but the game performance would get noticeably worse the longer i played. I have a decent rig and update drivers often.",negative

"Увы игра кусок сырого кала. У игры несомненно есть плюсы - красивый и атмосферный мир, даже подобие интересного сюжета. Но недостатки в разы перевешивают достоинства. Начиная с пустого мира, да он красив, да он атмосферен. Но чем дальше вы уходите от начальной локации - тем меньше побочных квестов дают нпс на новых базах, всё сведется к тому, что вы просто будете получать задания по типу ""иди принеси"" или же ""найди и убей"". И награждать вас за них будут просто валютой, которой вам понадобятся целые горы на починку снаряги, на улучшения, на всё подряд. Комбат является отдельной пыткой, мобы которые видят вас за километр, заливают свинцом без проомаха и вечно прокают блид, даже найдя артефакт который ""максимально"" повысит  ваш резизст вы не сможете его избежать. Встречи с мутантами это просто сюр, вас будут рандомно ими забрасывать, но получить выгоду с них вы не сможете, ведь даже облутать их трупы возможности нет. Просто потратите время, ресурсы и возможно нервы. Количество тех самых ресурсов тоже весьма ограничено. Да, можно сказать что это обусловленно ""реализмом"" и ""атмосферой выживания"", мол ты можешь взять только то, что тебе действительно необходимо, но благодаря этому возвращается проблема с стычками с мутантами и заработком местной валюты. Отдельного внимания заслуживают софтлоки. В первый час игры и на первом же побочном задании я словил баг, который полностью сделал невозможным продвижение в игре. Из вариантов решения 
1.Загрузить более старый сейв и надеятся что в этот раз вы его не словите
2. Скачать мод который вам добавит консоль разработчика и с её помощь пройти дальше.
Самое отвратное это ловить софтлоки в главном сюжете в котором от ваших решений зависит само развитие сюжета и его концовка. Вот только есть одно НО. Оба вышеупомянутых решения могут просто не заиметь никакого влияния. И вы либо тратите время на перезагрузку сейвов в надежде на фикс. Либо же забиваете на ""своё"" прохождение и идете по сюжетной ветке которая предоставляет вам игра. Если же вам не повезло ещё больше, то вы попросту скипаете фулл квест с помощью консоли.  Остаётся только надеяться что или же сами разработчики допилят эту игру или же мододелы это сделают за них.

"Well, this will be a long one. Wanted to explore every corner of the map and do everything (except picking every stash in the game since half of them are meh anyway) and now I can give my honest opinion of the game.
played on AMD Ryzen 5 5600x, AMD RX 6800 XT, 32 gb of ddr 4, 3600 mhz, cl 16, 

The good, the bad and neutral things. 

I will start with bad ones first: 
-poor optimization plagued game since release, fps drops ( especially bases with npcs), textures and objects popping up in a distance, visual bugs, some glitched textures here and there, memory leaks (Rostok base is good example) some places game will look impressive, like next gen graphics and in others like game from 2017 graphics, game would crash on loading screen, game would sometimes freeze if you enter anomalies or yeet you into outer space which can be funny couple of seconds before you realize that you have to force shut your game and turn it on again
- npcs would have strange routes and often go into anomaly and die, some of them would be stuck in doors or passages
-  enemies would sometimes feel like bullet sponge and yet sometimes you would kill some of them easy even if they look like they are equipped with good armor
- late game everyone are wearing some exoskeleton or high tier armor, it feels like armors are growing on trees....it ruins little bit that feeling that high tier armors should be hard to obtain and maintain
- enemies use guns like they have implemented aimbot, often hitting you from miles away with shotgun in pitch dark which kinda puts you in disadvantage, especially early game
- enemies spawning to close to the player and sometimes to often
- flashlight could be better, also no night vision or binoculars
- some quests can be bugged and you can't complete them without using mods
- game can feel sometimes like walking simulator.... I do like that not every npc can get you from place A to place B but there should be maybe a little bit more guides in game
- City of Pripyat needs more polish for sure
- some of the mutants like bloodsucker get overused in the game and they just become annoyance in late game
- some of the artifacts are kinda disappointing and while there is more of them compared to older stalker games, some of the artifacts from older games were nerfed making them meh to use...
- a couple of fights in the game against important characters felt underwhelming or mid at the best, like they are not awful but they could be better for sure and fps performance in those fights should be improved
- cutscenes in game can't use any upscaling it seems so game would go from smooth 120/130 fsp to 40/50 in cutscenes
To wrap it up, there are probably some more problems that I forgot to mention here but the ones that affected me the most were performance issues/ bullet sponge enemies/ aimbot enemies.

- Since I mentioned a lot of technical problems in negative section I have to start positive one with all the improvements that Stalker team made since release.

Positive things:
-My loading times are fast now and there are far less crashes than it was on release 
- Memory leaks in Rostok base are fixed in patches and I did not have any problem ever since
- Overall performance of the game is better than it was on release
- NPCs move more between areas and seem more active
- Zone feels more alive then on release and sometimes like warzone with all the shooting happening
- I did not have any main quest bugged or progress blocked cause of it ( I know some players have experienced this)
-The atmosphere is simply amazing. I never excepted it to be like old games since there is a bit nostalgia train there but game feels like stalker game and I truly enjoyed coming back to the Zone.
- sound design is nothing but excellent, from gun sounds, mutants, wind, rain, thunder, you name it, everything sounded great and helped me to immerse into this world
- game is huge, like the world is all the previous games and more merged together, a lot of places to explore
- exploration can be fun part and I did enjoy going to every piece of the map even if it was not always rewarding
- a variety of armors, weapons, modifications, I changed between 10-15 weapons in my playthrough and it was always fun to try something new
- gunfight is satisfying and all the animations for healing, drinking, eating are great in my opinion
- there are a lot of easter eggs in the game and references to different franchises 
- a lot of new characters and a lot of old ones from previous games
- most of the mutants feel good, they have upgraded models and some of them even sound creepier than before
- certain underground areas still have sense of uneasiness and fear that is super important, especially for people who played previous games 
- surprised with some locations/ anomalies and their design, devs definitely showed ambition, maybe too much of it :D
-despite having issues game felt like home to me...like seeing some gold old friend after a long, long time, it simply felt like it was made by people who love the franchise and they have vision for they want game to be
-I do miss Russian voice lines a little bit but I have to say that the Ukrainian voice lines sound amazing ( I played first playthrough in English to understand the story better without having to read everything on screen, but did watch the whole game in Ukrainian and I am planing my second playthrough in Ukrainian language)
- game has solid length if you follow only main story and it can be longer if you do side missions, for me, it feels long enough and with all the exploration and stuff I clocked around 170-180 hours in one playthrough which is pretty long for single player game 
- story is solid, a lot of mysteries from the past were kinda explained and a lot of more info we learn in this game
- cutscenes can be pretty cool and have cinematic feel
- new characters are introduced and I already like some of them 
- I find Skif good fit in Stalker franchise, at the beginning he felt kinda boring, but as the story progressed I found him more and more likeable
- I like that we again play someone who is not without combat experience but new to the Zone and being Stalker, kinda reminds me little bit of Stalker Call of Pripyat

Neutral things or things that do not bother me that much to go to negative section:

- English voicelines are like hit or miss for me, but mostly meh, they definitely could be done better
- game would bombard you with medkits/ bandages/ food a bit too much, it feels like they are everywhere in place that should be apocalyptic and extremely hard to survive
- night and day cycle could you some improvement, it seems like day is a bit short right now
- while I like the story and whole lore behind Stalker series was always fun to me, most of the endings in the game won't answer all the burning questions, leaving you with more to be desired... I do hope that future DLC-s wrap up some stories like Call of Pripyat did.

All in all I had fun playing the game and would rate it 7/10. There are problems for sure but positives outweigh negatives in my opinion and with lot of improvement on the way I believe this team could raise this game to become classic for all the fans of post apocalyptic games like Metro, Fallout or older Stalker games. I do plan to play it again once first DLC becomes available and hopefully by that time I will be able to give it higher score.

If you can't wait anymore to play this game then go for it but be ready to encounter some problems, if you have patience, wait a bit. The Stalker team is about to release more patches and game will probably just feel better in time :)",positive

"The bones of a fun game are here. It just feels like it's half finished. AI is whack, gun play feels awful, night vision is completely missing, and the visual bugs are rampant. I never played the Stalker games as a kid, but I enjoyed Drewski's videos of the Gamma modpack for the original games and I loved Escape From Tarkov, so I started my Stalker journey here. The opening mission of this game totally pulls you in and gets you pumped for the game. Then it's all downhill. I really hope this game gets some updates soon. I'd love to jump back in. But I wouldn't buy it as it is today.",negative
"I think, overall I still prefer the first game, but I really enjoyed my time with STALKER 2. The combat out in the open doesn't feel good, with enemies having 20/10 vision and laser aim, but its a lot more fun indoors and underground. The open world (or exclusion zone) is beautifully rendered and, in a vacuum, a joy to explore, but there's not actually many reasons to explore. Stashes dotted around the world are meant to be your main reward for exploration but they very rarely have anything worth the effort. I've already got 200 medkits and sausages, so finding a couple more isn't going to make me jump for joy...

But the gunplay otherwise does feel good, and the story... while a bit though to follow at times, is very good, especially a particularly heart wrenching storyline regarding certain villains and their attempt at redemption. The game isn't afraid to throw some bullshit moments at you, which are certainly frustrating at the time, but memorable enough to stick with you. I guarantee you nobody is going to forget a particular mutant + emission combo in the swamps any time soon.

While playing I did have to pause my playthrough for a few weeks to wait for a patch to be able to continue my story, so that wasn't great. but obviously the version you get now is going to be more patched and stable than the version I got on release.

So yeah, I recommend it, but the first game set a very high bar and I don't think this one quite reached it, but that isn't to say its not a fantastic game itself. Its flawed and janky and you need to put up with a fair bit to enjoy it, but I think you can say that about the other STALKER games too.",positive
"===================================================

My actual playtime is much longer than it shows on my account.

It's an enormous immersion breaker for me. As long as they don't make the AI life system believable. I am not interested in playing this game.

I can only hope.",negative
"I am a long time Stalker fan and love all the stalker games. They have all had their odd little quirks and jank-ness and this game is no different. However all the bugs I have found have been fairly minor. But since I have got to and past Rostok, I have had regular crashes. I have been using FSR3.1, which is probably the problem, but without that on the game is laggy, stutters and is just not as nice as with FSR on I have put 114 hours into this now and I just can't play it now, the crashes are getting worse and worse and I just can't play it now. 
I am so demoralised by this as I have waited for this game for a long time, but the game is very much a great addition to the stalkker games but there are some things that really let it down and make it feel like a far cry PoS.
The old stalker games felt alive like a story was being played out as you travelled through parts of the zone.
Now with this dynamic enemy spawning, its just feel like farcry as soon as you leave a factory building for example it'll have some guys there who you can't work out if they're friend of foe, which is ok, but if i scope the place out, then turn round and run 300m and run back there will be some other random lot of guys, there is no sense that you are achieving anything. You wipe out a camp run away run back and they're there again!
I don't like that.
Weapon types suck imo
no Bino or NVGs
Travelling is a tedious experience drinking energy drink every 15secs
which means you need to eat all the time
So you need 5kgs of redbull
and 5kgs or food just to run places
you are constantly fighting encumberance
Enemies have xray vision
NPC shotguns are ridiculous and have absurd range and accuaracy, but when you search the dead they have red condition boomsticks or 9mm smgs!
Mutants are great but waste of time and ammo as they give you nowt!

There is soooo much i love about this iteration of stalker, which is why i played for so long despite the things that annoyed me. I don't want the game nerf'd and made easy I just want it fixed, the difficulty is great, but tone down the NPC's xray vision and if some guy has smg spud gun that's red condition, he is not head shotting me behind cover at over 150-200m with iron sights..just no, sorry

Cant repair your gear in the field, which i hate. I went out one time from Duty base, gathered all the anomalys I could a various other bits and bobs to sell to make money, sorry coupons!! wtf coupons..urgh..anyway went out, got the stuff, drank 15 cans of red bull and tins of congealed meat only to make NOTHING as all the goods I sold equated to how much wear my gear took!!

But having moaned I do love this game, there is so much that is done right, I just wish it didn't hard crash on me after a short amount of time playing.

One thing I just remebered which I really hate: cutscene, I have pistol, silent UPD or whatever its called, cutscene I have makarov with no silencer, dispite having Skifs Makarov in my inventory!! wtf? 

Its all the little things that mount up to make this game a bit annoying, death by paper cuts

My last stalker experience was anomaly, that I added some mods to and made a great stalker experience that felt alive and that was free!!

If you want a great stalker experience download anomaly and mod it yourself and wait till this game works.",negative

The game is both beautiful and challenging.

I did not like that I had to be at a base to fast travel, i did not like shotgun snipers, and I hated the fucking Rodents (but I always have).

If you enjoyed the other Stalker Games, you will enjoy this one. If you haven't played the other games, then get on it and buy those too.",positive
bugs bugs bugs i have to slap my laptop with pesticide  just to keep it playable really great game when its not crashing ue5 looks good but christ on a bike it needs optimization they should have atleast sent a t shirt and some vaseline to the people who are paying full price if you enjoy playing newly released bethesda games then buy it your already trained to quick save every 5 mins and find alternate ways to complete bugged quest youll be right at home,positive
"This game is the epitome of a ""diamond in the rough"".
i give it a solid 9-10/10 genuinely as a core game. 
The world is alive, the attention to detail with the firearms, the gunplay itself. 
yes there are bugs and i would not try to deny but those can be fixed. 
To that effect, i had my first run save get corrupted about halfway ish through the story. but the game was *that* good that i willingly restarted and re did it all. These things will be and continue to be fixed by a team that cares about this game and you can tell it is truly a labor of love, despite all of the hardships the team is going through. 
It shines as well with only a few quality of life mods (i.e. mutant health balancing, repair costs, npc weapons are randomly generated modified, unique weapons can be modified, etc etc) and with the community this game has, in the next year or so the mods for this game will be truly something and i look forward to playing this game again in the future with a different path and the plethora of mods there will be. 
The team is going to be adding content as well over time which will also breathe life in to it over time. 
This game is worth multiple playthroughs. worth the purchase.",positive

"Awesome ride and everything I wanted from a Stalker game (fan of previous ones too).
The story is engaging and the exploration and fps action are the best part of the game.
Now while I loved the game it still has a lot of bugs so get ready to use the Unreal Debug Tool to reset some quests and spawn some missing NPCs and even pass through closed doors that should be opened...
For sure these bugs will be fixed in incoming patches but just know that if you get locked in a quest you can get yourself unstuck with the right console commands.
So even with its quest lines flow bugs I loved completing this game, will play Stakler 3 when it comes out.",positive

"I would like to say I loved this game, but I cant.

Having played the old Stalker games, I was hyped for this. But boy was I disappointed. The game is TERRIBLY unoptimized and my fairly powerful Legion PC had to use a mod to get it run even decently. The game looks like a ten year old game too, like Fallout 4. 

AI is shit, and there is no stealth. Enemies see you behind stuff from far away. Forget sneaking all together.

Mechanics feel old and clunky and it's buggy as hell.

"Unfinished product they are trying to sell at full price. Every other quest is bugged. I have some tolerance for bugs so long as there is a workaround, which I have been doing, but at the point in the Main Story Questline the Assault On Duga quest is entirely hindering progression, with absolutely so workaround available even via console commands. Cannot Progress the game any further. Bricked game.",negative

"This game is a colossal waste of time. I spent 40 hours in this piece of crap and as the game went on it was duller and duller. I finally had enough when there was a literal 2 hr period of time where i was just running 1km back and forth for nothing. The final straw was getting stuck in a labyrinth with dead ends and spending a half hour in there. They could have saved 2 hours of my life just by adding a simple fast travel mechanic. Its not like it would ruin the game. There is nothing fun or genuine about running, walking running walking, inventory management, run, walk, talk, kill an annoying mutant, inventory management, lose stamina, radiation damage, run, walk, talk, etc. I thought it would get better but it just got worse. What a waste of time. I knew i shouldn't have given this piece of crap a chance.",negative
"Less than 50 frames on minimal settings with rtx 3050 8gb (other parts are high over req). Frame generation makes game run smoother but you get 0.5 second latency in everything. This is THE ONLY GAME that runs so bad. Nothing to say about 2009 gameplay without innovations. This game req. at least 12 gigs of VRAM for stable 60 frames.
UPD. Patches make game run even worse. [spoiler] At fight with Faust framerate drops below 30 [/spoiler].
Game crashes more often with no reason. (1.2.1)
This game feels like it was designed for consoles only. Mouse input latency is way to bad for a shooter.",negative
"It has been quite a while since a game has gripped me like this. Sure it is definitely frustrating at times but so many times have I just walked away from my PC still thinking about it. Still thinking about the choices I made. And I have felt bad about some of them so often  was there no right choice it felt like. And in the end I got an ending I was satisfied with but it was not a good ending it was the least bad of the bunch it felt like. This game is something special and looking back at it now I'll jump in after some more patches again to mod it and try to do the other endings because damn is it special. 

Took me 62 hours for 1 ending. Will probably take hundreds more to do everything I wanted.",positive

Any technical feedback, complaints or otherwise, have probably already been said. Devs are working hard to fix the issues, and I believe they'll continue to make the game amazing.  But since my choice is a 'yes' or 'no' for the game, I'm giving this game a yes.

"Until the main quest is fixed I would suggest staying away from this game.  How is it even allowed to release a game you're unable to beat due to bugs?

Without spoiling anything in the game you basically go through a series of events in one of the main questline spots and then you end up in a room where you can't leave and the only person you can talk to just soft locks you where you can never end the conversation and have to force the game to exit.  I'm now permanently stuck in this room and can't play the game anymore.  Unless you save WAY before starting this part of the quest (and you have no way of knowing beforehand) you'll also most likely only be able to reload and redo the last few parts of the quest before getting stuck again.",negative
"Feels like a cyberbunk 2077 launch. The game is not ready, but has potential.

Your first experience will be a crash during shader compilation. Then you'll go looking for a solution. Fun!

If you figure that out you'll get a few hours into the game and wonder why it's so damn dark even during daytime. Weirdly, my biggest gripe that caused me to put this game away is the lighting. The poor lighting is not due to artistic decisions/immersion but poor tech implementation. Remember the bloom effect from Source 2 Engine? Lost Coast? Where they tried to simulate your eyes adjusting between dark and light environments by gradually dimming or brightening the screen? This game will be dimming and brightening your screen constantly, based on where you were looking previously, and how close or far you are from the object you are looking at. Indoors is a mess and completely unrealistic. You can fiddle with hdr/gamma/brightness all you want but it's broken. I was tempted to head over to Nexus for a fix but I've seen enough of the game to say I just don't care enough about what I've seen so far to fix it myself. 

Unfortunately I passed the refund windows and too eagerly bought the game when I didn't have time to play. Maybe in a year this game will be good. If you are desperate for a game to play, maybe you'll like this. If you don't care about graphics and just want to crank up the gamma/brightness to make the game look flat, grey and like a 2002 game, go for it. If you have limited gaming time, skip this for now and play a polished game instead.",negative

"S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl: As a player that has never played any of the previous games. I am humbled to the core to endorse this new iteration of the franchise. I've seen loads of videos on the previous games and of course the G.A.M.M.A Mod Pack. So going into Heart of Chornobyl, I knew what to expect from a S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game. Playing this game with no HUD and no Music is spine chillingly good. You become completely immersed in the spectacle world of Ukraine. I'm sure most know that GSC was under wartime conditions during the production of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl. The studio is based in Ukraine for those who didn't know. Knowing this before playing I chose to ignore the obvious bugs and unpolished aspects of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2. I am currently over 100 hours of playtime and have only just reached Pripyat. During my play sessions, I've fallen in love with the combat loops, exploration, puzzles, and dodging Anomaly to obtain those stunningly well modelled Artifacts. This game is a love letter to Ukraine, we have all seen the horrific footage of the war that is currently still happening there. I find it sad that its just fallen out of the media and been pasted over with derogatory stories and the woke agenda. 

Stepping into a village full of abandoned houses, climbing devastated concrete structures and looting underground bunkers or trenches has reminded me of Ukraine's struggle to force back the Russian occupation and I will not forget this.

Onto the story and cutscenes, The story itself is forged by the way you play in my opinion. You have at least 3 decisions in the main story missions to decide if you want to side with The Ward or The Stalkers. After hearing both sides to similar ideals for the fate of the same Zone. The character Skif himself is the deciding factor of either outcomes. The Cutscenes are stellar, a simple transition from Gameplay to Cutscene with no effort at all. The Mo-Cap for the animations are unique and seemless. I've heard rumours that GSC brought in the Director Ilya Naishuller who made the underrated film ""Hardcore Henry"" to direct the Scenes. True or not I think that's pretty damn cool.

All in all I'm very excited to see where S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 goes in the coming years via upcoming patches and the modded community. This game has the potential to have a come-back like CD Projekt Red's Cyberpunk 2077.

The old games were even more buggy (especially Clear Sky), so there was some development ;) Got through the game in 100h and loved every minute!",positive

"TL;DR:
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 (patch 1.1.4): Fantastic game buried underneath a crap ton of technical problems. Excellent starting point for modding. All updates so far have adressed the stuff they're meant to. The trend is upwards but there's still long way to go. I trust the developer to pull through, but I'll come back for second playthrough only after they're done. 

My review is mixed and can only recommend this game with mods.



The Good:
+The Zone is huge and seamless. No loading screens, except fast travelling. Bravo!

+Art direction. Trees feel familiar, suits and armor look amazing and their designs can be traced back to original trilogy.

+Core S.T.A.L.K.E.R. gameplay loop is intact. Your favorite EDC optimization simulator is still the same. Applause!

+Main story offers incredibly addictive lore expansion and interesting mythbusting moments. For me, SIRCAA was close to a religious moment. Иди ко мне.

+Cinematic cutscenes. Mocap, facial expressions devoid of uncanny valley, voice acting. Absolutely top notch! 

+Well written, modelled and voice acted key side characters. Strider's fate left a permanent dent in my psyche. 

+Gunplay compared to vanilla S.T.A.L.K.E.R.. I'll be damned, guns now shoot straight and the low crouch is gone. Models are excellent and reload animations are like butter. Guns also sound excellent.

+Quite tasteful memberberries. Places, people, items. They'll take you back oh so good.

+Rewarding exploration. Nooks and crannies have loot for days. Also, most stashes are now small puzzles to solve and may reward you with blueprints for equipment upgrading. 

+Modding is super easy, barely an inconvenience. I can't stress enough how important this is!

+Anomalies, their sound design and animations. A couple of new ones and couple of big ones too. Nice!



The Meh:
+/-Weapon selection took inspiration from mods but is still fairly small. And where's my AN-94?

+/-Very few new mutants

+/-Technical performance. I was sure my GTX 1080 TI wasn't going to cut it, but lo and behold it did... more on this later.

+/-Comically plentiful healing and survival loot

+/-At first glance, unnecessary location name changes. I assume they were originally in russian, but are now in ukrainian. Frankly, understandable change. Not well communicated at all though. Especially to those outside of Eastern Europe who don't know any better.



The Bad:
This whole section can be summarized as: immersion breaks. IMMERSION BREAKS EVERYWHERE. I was borderline ready to drop the game for these. 

-Fundamental failure at game controls. You're pretty much forced to use frame generation in one form or another, otherwise game looks pretty crappy. In my case, I had to deal with heavy mouse input lag despite using Reflex. X and Y axis have different sensitivities and it's non-adjustable. Mouse smoothing is on, no raw input. Both non-adjustable in game. I HAD TO USE FRICKING MODS TO FIX THE DAMN CONTROLS AND MAKE THIS GAME PLAYABLE!!!

-Foliage, trees and buildings aggressively popping into existence all the time. Absolute major distraction. Mods can alleviate some of it, but not entirely.

-Heavy ghosting

-You can't quicksave during combat or when being hunted upon. Only during quiet moments. This forces you to either deal with AI's bullsh!t (and get your pristine gear rekt), hope the game doesn't crash during long periods of non-saveble gameplay or redo entire firefights. It works more like a bad checkpoint system. Imagine fighting your way to Wish Granter in SoC in this way...

-Spastic, immersion breaking indoor lightning. While inside, HDR effect makes it look like it's constant nuclear explosion outside during day time. Objects glow distractingly (no no, not radiation) quite a while until fading into surrounding darkness levels every time you enter or exit buildings.

-Unnecessary transition animations. Unnecessary slow transition animations everywhere. Neat for 1st hour, after that just pure nuisance. Even Far Cry 4 from 2014 had in-game option to disable these. Mods can alleviate some of it.

-Extremely irritating auto lean function that cannot be disabled. Works well only with doorways, for anything else: it's just disrupting you aim. Metallic window bars trigger it, all small objects you pass by while ads crouching/sneaking trigger it. Sometimes it even leans you the wrong way. Useless, unnecessary rubbish.

-Hostiles spawning out of thin air in your field of view and engage you immediately. Hostiles STILL can see you through foliage and have near perfect aim in pitch dark. They can even shoot and track you through some metal housing containers and covers. AND their weapons have unlimited range. Get ready to get outranged by shotguns and MP5's at DMR distances. During the final mission I was nearly killed by TWO shotgunners pumping away buckshots from 150 meters away from pitch black corner to where even my Gauss Rifle's scope couldn't see. And I was rocking fully upgraded Diamond Exoskeleton + Compass artifact! And sometimes they'd just stand still and aim at room corner when I'm popping their friends unsupressed right beside them. A-life and AI both need considerable development and optimization. 

-Bloodsuckers, Deers, Chimeras and Pseudo Giants are ridiculously tanky, all mutants drop nothing and killing them wastes too much resources and weapon durability. I'd rather just run away. Also, specifically these three mutant designs are a straight downgrade from what they were in previous games. Especially Bloodsuckers. Controllers are nerfed into oblivion. And seriously, F*CK Chimeras with their one hit kill leaps. Mods to the rescue, maybe?

-Day and night cycle is comically short, each like 30min in real time. Get going in the morning and arrive to your mission destination ~1km away at night. Mods fixed it.

-Barely there hunger and sleep mechanic, but no need for water, tf? You can't even adjust how long you sleep.

-Barely any ambient music and it's mostly some weird drone ambience. And quiet too. I dreaded to go underground in any previous S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game even with night vision because of the ambient noises, creaks, echoes, mutant roars, air conditioning droning, etc. Now there's barely any noise, just derelict hallways and your crappy flashlight. And speaking of that...

-No night vision devices. Only one absolutely crappy headlamp that cannot illuminate anything beyond 15 meters. And you're supposed to do combat with that. No. Just no. 

-Somehow PKM uses 7,62x39mm ammo and you cannot buy it from traders. You have to scavenge it all. The correct 54R bullets are already modelled into PKM's ammo belt. WTH? They already have RPD's model in the game ffs! A revolver that uses SAME ammo as AS VAL and Vintorez somehow has more range and dmg than those two powerhouses. Yet, when reloading you can see the revolver bullets are definitely not modelled after 9x39mm. Submachine guns outdoing assault rifles... christ, the list just goes on and on.

-Ammo type icons (= ammo boxes) in HUD are way too small to differentiate what type you're using.

-English npc voice acting is distractingly, bloody hellingly Bri'ish. I'm sorry, I thought this was Ukraine. No slav accents, no hilariously cheesy meme material like in previous entries. Next playthrough will definitely be in Ukrainian language, even though I'm clueless about its intonation and emphazation.

-This gorgeous game needs dedicated photo mode.

-No binoculars to differentiate neutral and hostile entities. You just have to reveal yourself to upcoming mob and monitor your immersion breaking Far Cry'ish threat indicator. And it doesn't help that you can't visually differentiate most factions from another at a distance.

-In-game cutscenes, contrary to cinematic ones, are awful. Dead eyes, stiff mouth movement, etc. 

-The greatest banger of our life time is gone: no Bandit Radio. Disappointment = immeasurable, day = ruined.",negative
Highly addictive story and game play.,positive
"Great game. Its filled with content, fun, interesting. If you are a fan of the franchise, its a must bugs or no bugs.
If you are not a fan of the franchise and want a shooter, I would advise to wait a year or two until the bugs have been ironed out, its filled with game breaking bugs that will lead you in to a rabbit hole of how to fix them so you can progress the game, it will lead you to back tracking saves for hours back ( I had to back track over 7-8 hours of saves just for 1 fix, and I had 3 similar so far).

Dont get me wrong, the game is good, especially under the circumstances that we could have not had it at all because of multitude of reasons, but its for sure buggy.

Can you enjoy it ? Yes. But do not expect a game without bugs, it will have many, and it can occur as in my case at the 30-50-70h mark, and you will have to loose a lot of progress and re-do it.

Overall The game is good, its fun, enjoyable, and exactly what I have expected, coming from a stalker 1 long LONG time fan. But be warned that its not flawless. Also the fact that you have only Ukranian that nobody in the world understands, and English that is VERY VERY VERY VERY poor executed ( I advise you to NEVER use English for this game, better use Ukranian and read the subtitles, also this is very tiresome). Sadly Russian was removed for obvious reasons, but that langauge is not used in Russia only, and should have not been removed in my opinion. I am Bulgarian, and my granny is from Moldova and my grand dad is from Ukraine, but i know only Russian, and this excludes people like me from enjoying and understanding the game.

A language should not have been politicized, a region could have been excluded, but not the language.",positive
pretty good wasnt a fan of how it turned into cod at the end but hey i get it they wanted it to be more exciting i would suggest running through instead of trying to kill em all you will run out of ammo hopefully they change that but i doubt it,positive
"I rarely buy games at full price, but when I tried S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2, I knew I would love it—and indeed, I did. I played through the whole game despite heavy performance issues. I have high hopes that GSC Game World will continue to improve it over time.",positive
"Too many performance issues feels like more since release, game is buggy",negative
"Unfortunately I can't recommend this game in its current state.
Then why did I played it for almost 200h? I was making a youtube guide covering all the stashes so it took a lot of time. You can check those out here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gLdnVOCnjX12Ad3IrQC6jZ0-vQcp6An

TLDR

The game is fun and awesome as you start playing it. It's beautiful and captures the atmosphere of the first games and the zone.
But as you play the experience deteriorates and what was fun becomes frustrating. Stashes are not woth looking for, constantly respawning enemies are annoying, even more as they snipe you from max distance with shotguns. You start to encounter more and more game breaking bugs and loading quick saves become more often.


Economy and Loot

In short - it sucks. I can surely say that I've seen at least 90% of the stashes and only few of them are worth getting. That is very disappointing because as a Stalker you go in to the zone to look for valuables and when you finally get to that stash you were after there's a can. a bandage, mad kid and some pistol ammo inside. And stashes don''t contain any money.
Looking for stashes and exploring the zone is absolutely not worth your time.

From time to time your gear will need repairs and only a technician can do it for you. Usuall it costs more money than you get from doing a quest so you will end up looting weapons from defeated enemies and going back and forth to bring all you can to the trades so you can finally afford an upgrade or so. And you can't sell weapons that are to damaged. This is especially frustrating at the start of the game where you don't have much.
It's getting even worse as you fight mutants as they don't drop anything you can sell.

You can of course go and look for artifacts. Imagine my disappointment when I found unique artifact worth 75 000 only to learn that the trader will offer me 20 000 or so for it.

Combat

Guns in this game feel very underwhelming once you get your hands on them. They are pretty good in enemy hands though :)
I ended up running with assault rifle and shotgun as most players do. Shotgun is an amazing weapon for all most encounters and I was using my trusted pump-action throughout the whole game.

Forget about sniper rifles and sneaking. Sneaking dosen't worh well and enemies will notice you very quickly and sniper rifles are useless as enemies can snipe you with any gun. Shotgun snipers are especially annoying. Yes, as soon as enemy is in shooting range he will shoot at you with spectacular accuracy. Shotgun blasts from 100m are a common occurrence in Stalker 2.
Ther's only one thing worse, an enemy unit of 5 soldiers all equipped wirh RPM-74 heavy machine guns. You gonna have a bad time.

Another annoying thing that got more and more frustrating as I played is enemy spawn. Enemies can spawn from thin air around you. For example you check the map or inventory, you hide it and there are 5 enemy soldiers in from of you where there was nothing seconds ago.
This gets more frustrating toward the end of the game as all enemies are wearing exoskeletons in late game.
Last mission was a real pain in the bottom with infinitely spawning enemies.

Bugs

Game is full of bugs. Everyone want devs to fix A-Life but let's be honest, they never fixed it in the first game so why do you think they will in this one.
There are some major, almost game breaking bugs, like main NPC bugging out during main story mission locking you out of progression. And just now when I was about to finish the game if frozen during a conversation at the very end of the game. Three times. So I won't be able to finish it probably for some time waiting for a patch.

All in all the game may be good and fun in the future when they patch the hell out of it. Right now it's better to buy something else.",negative

"To begin: I love S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2. I will still recommend the game but with some caveats. However I have one major problem.

The single biggest issue I can't look past is being unable to remap most keys, specifically any of the important ones. I only want one button to open the PDA, no one wants five. I constantly go to open my inventory among other things and instead constantly open the PDA which gets me killed.

A minor related gripe is that you cannot have your four quick item keys be F1-F4 like in every other game, it requires you to use Q and E instead and is one of the functions you can't remap. Well, you can remap them, but then it either just straight up does nothing or at worst, half way rebinds the keys but then it doesn't seem to unwrite the previous key's binding so if you remap one of the 5 or whatever keys that opens the PDA to something else like your detector, every time you use it you will pull out your detector and then it forces you to open the PDA after you put the detector away. Most (if not all) keybinds have this issue.

Q and E are the lean functions in every single other game I have played that has leaning, but in GSC's infinite wisdom they instead made Q and E quick-use keys for meds and whatnot instead of going to the first 4 F keys like before. Now the keys are Z and C which are not only more difficult to use as intended, but again you CANNOT REBIND them. You ""can"", but it doesn't work. I know how to rebind the keys in the menu, it does not work. I've found mentions of opening the config file to fuck with it to get them to stay and I don't want to mess something up. I shouldn't have to do that to use a basic game function.

I can look past the kind of things that require Q&A for testing like mid or late game quests and triggers that are effected by major patches and what not, but we are well past launch and this is still an issue. Why have the option for key rebinding if it does nothing?

Please GSC, changing key binds is a basic function. It's been months. I got the game for my birthday, I'd been looking forward to it for a decade. I had to save for ages to get the ultimate version because I'm broke as shit. Stalker 2 is one of the only new game I've gotten in 2 years.

Please fix this.",positive

"Not worth it, the game is buggy especially around the middle. Performance issues through prolonged gameplay, uninteresting story and also the map makes zero sense. It feels like a stalker RPG than actual stalker. Nonsensical ledges and confusing map layouts. Consistently frustrating.",negative
"now, time to go to actual Chernobyl!!!",positive
"Game is amazing, it has a few bugs that will occur but with such a massive open world, that is bound to happen. It looks like as of the latest patch 1.2 that game breaking bugs have been resolved, so back to recommending this game. 

This is like Metro 2033 had genetically perfect baby. It has all the survival and resource management of Metro but with an open living world. You get to feel like you are in a living Wasteland. If you are stealthy, you can see mutants hunting and hiding. You can see NPC's wandering and engaging with each other. You can just be a ""stalker"" and hunt for artifacts without doing main quests, and it still feel accomplishing.

Combat is extremely rewarding. Engagements don't feel like ""the big guys"" are just absorbing bullets because their higher level, A headshot will take down most enemies, and the tougher enemies have LORE accurate reason to feel more tanky. ",positive
"It’s very hard to give an honest review of a game like Stalker 2 since like sure the shooting and combat to be tact, is good to mediocre. The Atmosphere, art direction, attention to details in environment and so much more is so godly though that the game makes up for many of it’s shortcoming. I will probably come back right more once the game gets some updates or the planned DLC. For now the biggest gripe I have is early to mid-game economy being rather unfair with how many mutans and especially blood suckers are roaming the zone. The AI and the way that the draw distance spawns things in this game feels like a mild down grade from Pripyat as well. 

But like dear god does this game come through on it’s art direction, sound design, and oppressive atmosphere. It’s a master class in mood and pacing. I’d highly recommend the game even at full price, if that’s too much go play Pripyat or something.

"Still needs time to Fix A-Life (core part of the series and was missing on launch), performance is still nail biting, lots of memory leaks and stuttering that mods can partly fix (UE5 moment). Gunplay is way out of balance, large lack of side quests (more so for factions). Ill write a better review when it deserves my time when ready. For now, it felt like a linear story game in the shoes of a open world RPG exploration game (i.e it tried to be like METRO exodus but true open world, but lack of side content means most of it has nothing to do). The atmosphere is almost there but I when playing shadow of chernobyl back to back, its just missing something and I hate that I cant fully enjoy it. I really hope it improves and grows.",negative
optimized so badly...dissapointed,negative
awesome game! has some bugs but its worth playing,positive
good game good graphics good story good animation good bugs,positive
First time playing the Stalker series and really appreciate the care and atmosphere of this game. I love the metro games and this seemed like a no brainer I can not wait to see how the story unfolds.,positive
really good storyline & nice fps,positive
Game is perfect for those players who truly enjoy getting lost in an open world and just scrounge to survive.,positive
"I don't outright recommend this game.
It captures the atmosphere of stalker really well and there is a lot to love about it but the developers use a lot of lazy corner cutting like immortal NPCs to prevent access to locations on the map instead of story and work phenomenons like previous versions of the game.

The game frequently points you to locations for stashes and items in areas that are guarded by said immortals as well.
There is a point of no return during the main campaign that it does not warn you about and leading up to it the game uses several scripted moments with emissions and unkillable enemies to force you to b line for said point of not return further degrading the experience.

A life has been improved but its still not great, you can clear an area and then next thing you know a squad has spawned right behind you. The game loves two things Bloodsucker and then rodents, if you're out and about or at like any cave or potentially significant building expect 1 to 3 blood suckers (these creatures are no longer unusual they are probably the most common creatures in the zone).

Guns are arbitrarily balanced based on time of acquisition so you'll want a mod to re-balance that unless you want pistols and higher tier auto rifles to be the only logical choice

Overall it's different to the older games, honestly those older games are a tad dated as well and I wouldn't play the OG or clear skies without a mod or two so I guess its up to your thoughts.
I am going to commit to finishing this play through but I am not sure I will be returning, I am very worried about their proposed remasters and how many of these poor decisions will be brought into them. 
Thankfully I have the classic versions of these games which I do feel are superior in a lot of ways.",positive
"Overall the setting, the vibe, the atmosphere is true to Stalker universe.

Visuals are really, really good.

But game is not fully ready. This is mainly seen with game's poor optimization and A-life 2.0 being no existent.

There are plenty of hate comments from russians, offended that GSC (Ukrainian company) decided not to add russian language into the game. Moreover, russian government considers to give 5 years sentence for anyone who has this game on hard drive! There are 1 dollar reward for anyone who will add hate comment with low score!

Not to the game itself. It is true STALKER game, great addition to the series.

It has great atmosphere, try it! GSC will fix and balance the game 

Game requires a serius optimzation work. A-life is not there, enemy just spawns behind you ~50 meters away. You clear the area of some enemies, you start looting, the game spawns them again, you kill them and again game spawns them after a few minutes. Same as cops were in Cyberpunk 2077, you turn away and AI spawns behind you...

If they continue working on the game, then optimization will be improved over the time.

But for A-Life 2.0 part, it requires a serious work on it. AI seems like a placehoder here.

As of writing this. The game is more raw than ready. Needs much more work.",positive
"Genuinely a long time fan of the STALKER series and have been waiting for the release of this game for years. While the release of the game is exciting, the state the game has been released in is near unplayable. While the modding community has been fantastic in attempting to smooth the experience, it is still not quite there yet. This game needs some major updates before I'd recommend it as it's extremely buggy and suffers from major performance issues.",negative
"I have to say this is game has amazing ambiance, story telling, and overall just a great representation of the the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone. And possibly one of my favorite games but I cant give it a positive review due to how terribly optimized the game is. I wanted my first play through to be entirely without mods but there are certain main quests in this game that at the moment are impossible to due without going back through hours of playtime to correct. Even using a 3090 and a very high end CPU and 32Gbs of DDR5 ram the game in spots rums terribly not just with FPS but with lag and stuttering. Graphics up close are amazing but after around 30 meters or so the game looks like a blurry and textured mess, even with max view distance I can see stuff come in and out of view at ranges that I shouldn't have this problem. This problem became worst in Pripyat where building at around 40 meters become a mess and FPS drops are rampant. I do hope that GSC can pull a Cyberpunk 2077 and make the game amazing but until then I will be leaving this as a negative review truly a shame :((((",negative
So damn gripping. Really love the combat. This is my first stalker game and I can't say I am disappointed. Its a little rough bugs and stability wise as of right now...but I played through Cyberpunk 2077 throughout its shitty endeavours and this is leagues ahead. Devs you have my attention and my heart for now...please do right by us. I will support you more once the stability is improved. Can't wait to get the DLC for this later.,positive
"This game has so many issues with crashing and not booting up that I can't recommend it due to how frustrating it can be just to try and play it. Every time they patch it, it somehow gets worse. It's a real shame because when it does run, its very fun to play. They need to stabilize the game before I can recommend this to anyone",negative
"This game is a mess. It plays like crap on 4k and is nothing compared to the older games. I am so disappointed in this game after all this time. Controls are terrible, game levels are nuts. Even on the rookie level its extremely difficult. This game is all smoke and mirrors. Looks good but doesn't run. Voices are misplaced. This is eastern Europe why no Russian accents like the older games? A bunch of UK people? A waste of time and money!!!  Patch after patch after patch. The fan boys are sticking up for a substandard product. If you market a game it is supposed to be to the average player, you can always have hard levels or an extra hard level. I was waiting for this game like a kid at Christmas and when I opened the package it was underwear. So sad! I loved all the older games and thought this would be better, if it was even possible. I was wrong!",negative
"[strike]Can't recommend it.

Been playing for 60h+ and having no issues with performance. But suddenly the game decided to kick the bucket and run at a enjoyable 3fps.

Repair costs are astronomical and you can't enjoy trying new weapons without stuffing yourself full of loot, crawling at a snails pace back to a vendor and selling stuff over, and over to be able to experience using mid-late game weapons/armors.

Quests offers no coupons to even suffice the cost of getting the quest done, or even count for repairs.

Game has been worked on, patches are being released. But for now, I can't recommend it until it's fixed.[/strike]

Patch 1.2 resolved all these issues.",positive
"I have around 30 hours with the game so far. The game play was really enjoyable and I loved the environment. Even with all the bugs and technical issues I would of still recommend the game. 
However after the recent patch I am unable to play the game at all. It will always crash when I boot the game. I can't even get to the main menu anymore. I have spend hours troubleshooting and nothing I do seems to work. For now I am uninstalling and hope future patches fix these issues so I am able to finish the story.",negative
STALKER is still buggy after the 2 latest updates. I am now mid of the game and can not continue due a Flying Glitch. I find myself in nowhere. Loading previous savings also didnt help when reaching the same position where the Flying glitch starts.,negative
yes,positive
"First playthrough, some side quests, 70h... great time if you are willing to tolerate the state of the game currently, had few bugs, but crashes were frequent, lags and FPS drops as well. I will definetly  come back for second playthrough after some time.",positive
"in short: 14 years in the oven and this is what comes out? GSC didn't cook with this one, they overcooked. literally to charcoal. I have my reasons here why I dislike this game.

-performance is absolute ass. you will need to use frame gen and that just makes everything look shit and also creates a lot of frame latency and input lag. with frame gen you will get 100 fps no problem, but still expect memory leaks leading to massive fps drops. don't get me started on entering areas that are more populated.

-the gunplay is horrible, it just feels so weird to shoot, the recoil is slow and trying to track your sights on enemy while firing is just so frustrating. also every bullet that hits you makes your aim jerk all the way to Siberia, as far as Kamchatka.

-ai is extremely downgraded. the original trilogy had awesome fights with the mutants and other stalkers. it also worked so that you could get out of a fight without a scratch. for example - dogs used to have a pack system. one dog attacks while the other distract you by running around in circles and if only one dog is left in the pack, it gets scared and starts to run away. but now they all just mindlessly charge you.

-none 7.62 AK, none SG 550, none mosin nagant? i mean atleast the SG could have appeared, it was in the original trilogy.

-also why completely strip the identity of the meds? hercules used to be a bottled drink, vinca and psy block used to be a blister pack of pills. haven't even seen anti-dote, radioprotectant or anabiotics, what happened to those?

-no russian voice acting? the war between Ukraine and Russia is a war between governments, not between cultures. stop the russophobia. also the name changes. Yaniv? No, its Yanov. Ahroprom? No, its Agroprom.

-a-life system, if it even exists in the game, is also dogshit. the zone feels so dead, until the fucking enemies spawn in your face and then you turn around and they are gone.

-there is seriously no need for photorealistic graphics. for example gamma achieves top tier immersion with graphics that feel absolutely cracked yet it is actually running on a nearly 18 year old engine that only was upgraded to be 64 bit.

-bugs, bugs, bugs. cant remember how many times I was soft locked and had to reload. mission items don't appear, npcs get stuck...

-literally couldn't recognize many of the characters from the original trilogy. Why ditch the stalker artstyle for stupid photorealism.

-what the fuck is up with the over abundance of food everywhere? just relocate african population to the Zone and the world hunger problem is over!

-the headlamp is well that - a fucking oil lamp casting weak piss yellow light without any shadows.

-the default binds are just eugh, what the hell. Q and E for quick actions instead of leaning? what the hell happened to F1-F4 for quick actions? instead you put lean on Y and C? what the fuck GSC, I had a stroke just trying to understand it. thank god you can rebind it.

-the loot in stashes is just a fucking joke. for example i once found three 5.45 rounds and a bread in a stash.

-no 3D pda? come on, every stalker conversion mod managed to make a 3D pda, yet overhere it is just a fullscreen overlay. such immersion breaking.

--------------------

the only good things this game brings is new lore and the massive map. otherwise I am very dissapointed. i could probably rant more but who is even going to read this. just needed to relieve my emotions about this.

honestly if I could, I would just port the stalker 2 map and the storyline to stalker gamma and be forever happy, but that is just a pipe dream, just wishful thinking. :(",negative
"Richly atmospheric, tense moments, and solid enough combat make for an engaging open world game. There's still a few bugs, questionable design decisions (such as one mission having infinitely spawning enemies that is a mechanic you weren't expecting, is rather awful, and never seen again, thankfully), and some balancing that feels obsolete. But a few mods easily corrects that, and you're left with a solid zone to explore.",positive

"S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Disappointment with Potential
I've been waiting for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 for many years, but the game leaves mixed impressions upon release. The graphics look raw: terrible LOD rendering, poor lighting, lack of dynamic shadows and the promised A-Life 2.0 make the world less alive than expected. The environment elaboration also leaves much to be desired.

The gameplay is not without its flaws. Weapon upgrades have virtually no effect on the appearance of the barrels, there are no binoculars, a normal flashlight or a night vision device, which greatly limits immersion. There is a lack of improvements that could improve the atmosphere and convenience of the game.

Despite this, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 has great potential. If the developers fix the technical problems, refine the mechanics and make the world more alive, the game can become a worthy continuation of the legendary series. We are waiting for patches and improvements!

And ofcourse I'm looking forward what contribution will community make. 

P.S. No negativity, it's just unfair to make all players your beta testers and not live up to their expectations.",negative
"its a great game! Usually I am not really into looting or RPG themed shooters but this one is really good. Got 25hrs on the clock while I write this and no signs of getting tired of game. For me one of the best games in at least 3-4 years.

Only critic: I encountered a bug (Find Col. K*, he wasnt to be found where he should have been at first), was not game-breaking and once I understood thats a bug the solution was easy (wait for next emersion). If that wouldn´t have happened it would be a solid 10/10, but for now its an (still awesome) 9.5/10 for me.",positive
"I'm only a dozen hours in, but I've noticed the game is regularly freezing when using the trade menu / inventory. I'm seeing 100% memory usage (I have 96gb RAM, a 4090oc and a 9800x3d) so how is this possible? Twice now, the game has frozen.

I can't sell guns, so walking around heavy. I have to drop them on the floor. The game itself is so far very slow and boring. Uninteresting missions, same old looting inventory, and the graphics just don't seem very modern at all, nor many of the mechanics.

So far I'm not impressed, but will return once I've finished the game with an update.",negative

"With Patch 1.2 some of my points have been addressed  and so i will adjust the review to suit

STALKER 2 ... what a Disappointing mess 

firstly the good points 

1. the world and atmosphere are truly stunning ( at times ) the visuals, the weather and the general feel of the zone feels right. 

2. umm

the BAD points 

1. the Days feel extremely short. 

2. the story feels longer than it should, dragging on and on.

[strike]3. the shotgun Sniping AI at 100 yards gets old really fast.[/strike] 


[strike]4. By the end game every one and there dog is wearing an EXO suit which kills immersion[/strike] 

5. the missions themselves become so buggy and broken in the second half that in makes the game a rage inducing chore.

6. Where is the A-LIFE ... 

7. exploration is boring because of the lack of A LIFE and enemy's simply spawn 100 meters away every time in plain sight

[strike]8. Spongy Mutants that offer no real reason to kill, save your money and go around them[/strike] 
 

9. a hunting shack is in Rostock who bets its gonna be DLC, me 

10. the weather ... well 5 seconds of sun followed by the same storm every day 

11. the factions feel so watered down there might as well only be two, the good and bad guys.

12. the entire game uses 4 faces for every NPC which kills immersion seeing the same face again and again, even the older games never had this problem because they gave every one gas masks 

[strike]13. radiation is a shell of its former self, one of the most radiated sites on earth and i all you need is a single bottle of vodka[/strike]  

14. a real lack of weapon variety for a 2024 game. 

15. the writing feels at times it was done by a child.

16. pointless side mission that offer no replay ability.

17. NO GAME PLUS 

18. Side missions offer such poor pay outs the ONLY way to make money is the find and sell artefacts

19. repair cost can spiral out of control and with the enemy EXO problem this can becomes a chore later in the game  

20. pripyat is only used for the last 4 missions wasting such an iconic location. 

21. No binoculars and no night vision kills this game at times as the nights drag on longer than the days you cant see the hit scan shooting AI at 100 yards which is just not fun

Overall STALKER 2 is such a Disappointing experience which i blame on the fact that the game was built for the console.
the weapon wheel has no place in this game, no F1 to F4 hot keys, and an overall structure that feels like a Ubisoft game...

boring, bland and shallow",negative
"I finished the game last week, and yes it has bugs. Yes it will frustrate the crap out of you. However, the story is strong, the variety of weapons and weapon mods make the game interesting.

My only real complaint is the weight management you're constantly doing. It's a bit too realistic for my taste. (until you get to find the right artifacts/armor)",positive

"Either you'll learn to manage your Ukrainian crypto or prepare to die. 
Well, prepare to die anyway.",positive
"Had a rough launch regarding bugs and performance issues, had to play most of the way on the lowest settings just to get a stable framerate, especially in towns. I beat the game after about 100 hours and the final mission was tough. Without giving everything away [spoiler]it's basically a very long, drawn out series of fights like the previous games[/spoiler]. I didn't really understand the ending I got but I guess it was the good one?

I found a lot of the firefights with humans to be frustrating, since they would spam throw grenades at you constantly and had pin-point accuracy. There were many times where I would get ambushed by a group of bandits in the middle of an open field with no cover, and despite being 100 meters away I'd be pelted by buckshot the entire time. The gun-play on the player's end is much better than previous games but it was still frustrating to get shot through an entire forest where there's absolutely no way they could see you.

Despite everything I looked past it all and found myself immersed in the world. It was always exciting to find a new anomaly field and go artifact hunting, or take on a small mission to kill some mutants, so I could have enough money for a couple more bullets. Overall, I was sad it was over, but I'm excited for the modding scene to make the Anomaly mod so I can play again fresh.

Oh and fuck the swamp.",positive
"The big red thumbs down does not mean this game is bad. I really like this game. I like the story, the mechanics, the shooting, the pacing, it's a great game. I don't recommend it solely based on the performance and lack of visual quality.

Unreal 5 is thus far a terrible engine, I have a well above average PC and the games performance just isn't there to make it as enjoyable as it could be. Optimization in games has gone to the wayside, AI generated frames look bad and feel bad.

If none of that is of any particular concern to you, then this game is incredible, if you like a smooth experience with a good-looking game, then I do not recommend.",negative

"while i can say that there are quite a bit of bug i can say i enjoy even being stuck or restarting the game due to bug, the realism, the chaos of the zone just feels incredibly immersive, I cannot wait for multiplayer to come out for this because that's all this baby needs now. graphic are pretty and everything is pretty smooth compared to when it first came out. if your iffy on this game just wait for a sale but i hope you give this game a chance to shine. lately the gaming community has been shooting games down before they get a chance to come out of early access so by the time it comes out fully released (if it ever does) the player base is completely gone.",positive
"This game is barely playable because of it's horrible bugs, but that's not the worst part, it's also badly designed, which becomes obvious when you realize that nighttime lasts longer than daytime and you don't have night-vision goggles so you can actually see enemies, it basically shows the developers thought it would be 'SCARY' just because 80% of the time you can't see anything, it really shows some of the baby-bird brain thinking going on at GSC.",negative

Reviews in steam of the game doesn't match the reality!
Russians are forced negative reviews for this game, because of war.
Don't trust me, don't trust the revs. Just download the game and try it by yourself!
I began to play from 1.0 version of the game, it was a bit buggy, but it's the best shooter that I played for many years.
For now game has a lot of updates and bugs are fixed, but even early they was a minor. Don't know why people so nerves about that. Sometimes it's make the game so fun:)
Can't wait until DLC coming:)",positive
"I LOVE IT.  Played the original STALKER on release, and CLEAR SKY.  
AMAZINGLY immersive game, with amazing graphics, fantastic gunplay, and some of the best sound design I've ever encountered in a game.  
The world is incredible, and the combat is really well designed.  The world feels very alive, and both frightening and incredibly beautiful.  The lighting in the game is phenomenal, and brights beauty to each open field, or sunken village.
But honestly nothing is better than the sense of wonder encountering reality shifting anomalies, getting revenge on enemies that had pinned you down when they suddenly get flanked by an invisible mutant bloodsucker.  

The game has a few bugs from MY experience, but I honestly have not experienced the bugs and massive performance issues some people claim to have experienced.  I did encounter a massive slow down for about 8 seconds when entering one FULL neutral fortress, but aside from that no major frame drops.

Everything feels weighted, and the world feels very full for a radiated zone.

ONLY about 18 hours right now, but loving how the game plays to the point that any minor annoyances (like a few dialogue menu choices) havent kept me from wanting to play more.  

Edit: Playing a few more hours, and have had a couple of memory leaks in Slag Heap - as well as a few bugs (pretty well documented by community now including the Sawmill quest).   I think of them like anomalies.

Frustrating, but not game breaking.  Still playing!

I think one of the often overlooked parts of this game is how well paced it easy despite the ability to basically go and do whatever you want.  Have never felt completely over my head, even in moments where I have no idea what is happening or what weird phenomenon might kill me right around the corner.

"Well game is actually fun at first 5 to 10 hrs and then it gets boring and buggy clunky mess. Monsters randomly spawning on you. Weird sounds audio is buggy too. Shooting guns in that game is really fun killing bandits is fun. But the vert nades are crazy and sometimes they see u somehow when u cant see them. Also something i noticed in combat is that when bandits, stalker any human. When they are hiding they just randomly shout ""Hiding here "" ? Like bruh. Its my first ever stalker game ive played. And also those Anomalies and monsters dont make much sense. idk maybe im just hater but i really liked the game before. And now im at the point where I spawn constantly in a boss fight sum huge rat ass lokin mf. If i run it kills and if i beat it then its emission and im in swamps so there is no shelter and im constantly getting Penetrated like that atm. Hope it helps anyone at all. :)

Too many bugs currently,negative
"At its core, this is a very good game.  The story, atmosphere, sound effects, and gunplay are top notch.  However, this game is still VERY buggy.  Several times I had to use console commands to be able to progress the main story, and it crashed quite a bit.  I can see there being issues with side missions etc, but the main story having these problems is unacceptable.  

Also, holy good GOD is this a walking simulator.  I spent hours upon hours just walking and running from place to place.. while there are some fast travel options available, it's still a shitload of traversing on foot.  While the scenery is cool and I can see it suiting those who like to explore every nook and cranny, this really put a damper on things for me and honestly by the time I beat the game I was so glad it was over.. it became a literal slog.  

In conclusion, if you can overlook the bugs, love open world games with exploration and a good story you will like this game.  Otherwise if you get frustrated with bugs like me I would steer clear until they roll out some more patches in the coming months.",negative
Late game is a buggy mess.,negative
"After spending 122 hours in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl, I can honestly say this game is something special. The graphics are absolutely stunning, making the Zone feel real and alive. The atmosphere is on another level, dark, eerie, and completely immersive. Whether you're walking through an abandoned village at dusk or creeping past an anomaly-filled wasteland, the world just pulls you in. Every little detail, from the lighting to the environmental sounds, makes the game feel incredibly believable.

Exploration is easily one of the best parts of the game. There is so much to find, from hidden stashes to powerful weapons, unique armor, and strange anomalies. The world constantly rewards curiosity, although I must say often it's just medkits and some ammo. However, no two journeys feel the same. You never know what you will run into next, whether it is a random firefight, a terrifying mutant ambush, or some mysterious anomaly that takes the attention. The game really nails that feeling of surviving in an unpredictable and dangerous world.

That said, it is far from perfect. Unreal Engine 5 is still not optimized, and the game is very performance-intensive. Frame drops and stuttering can be frustrating even on high-end hardware. Ultra+ modteam did a great job optimizing the shortcomings of the engine. The mod is worth to download. The AI can also be buggy, sometimes acting erratically or having an unfair advantage. There are also occasional mission bugs and other small issues that can break immersion. Despite these problems, the experience is still well worth it.

One of the best things about Stalker 2 is the modding community. There are already a ton of great mods on Nexus that improve different aspects of the game, from performance fixes to gameplay tweaks. It has been a pleasure experimenting with them, and they really help smooth out some of the rough edges. Overall, I am very satisfied with the game. The beginning is incredible when everything is new, the middle can feel a bit slow, but the ending finally brings a sense of relief. If you love immersive worlds and can handle a few rough spots, this is definitely worth playing.",positive
"This game is So perfect yet so flawed at the same time. one: the sound design? a chefs kiss. it really makes you feel like your really there. two: it is really REALLY FUCKIN difficult. some people (like me and many others) are masochists,and we LOVE TO make oursleves hurt. the zone doesnt care who you are. you got a wife? cool. You got a degree in theorical science? dope. You have 7 children? nice. your family is in debt? cool. THE ZONE DOESNT CARE ABOUT THAT SHIT. it really is unforgiving,and i really love it. but the bad news? wait...whuh MY FRAME RAAAAAAATE!!! i play this game on medium Graphics,and STILL,sometimes my frames would cease to exist. also,minor gripe. the assault rifles do NOTHING well past midgame. and for me,this doesn't make sense. because the AR416 for example,which is based of the HK416,a rifle that fires 5.56x45 mm,and the Integral-A,which is based of the Kriss vector,a 45 ACP SMG. although,there are some versions of the Kriss vector that fire 9x19 parabellum. and guess what: the SMG does Slightly less damage then an intermediant rifle cardridge.i don't like that there is such a small difference between these two weapons. maybe make the damage of the AR416 higher to 1.15? also,the 5.56x45 M885 round is launched at a speed of 3,020 Feet per second,so its pretty decent at penetrating body armor. anyway,feel free to critizize me in the comments.",positive

"Stalker 2: A Return to the Zone with Growing Pains

Stalker 2 does a great job of capturing much of the charm and atmosphere of its predecessors, but ultimately falls short due to some noticeable issues. Beneath these flaws there is a solid game and the development team is actively working on patches and collaborating with the community to address them.

++The Good++

- The Zone: Beautiful and scary, the environment is immersive and atmospheric.
- NPCs: Character models are impressive, and the voice-acted dialogue is expressive, 
- Weapon Upgrades: Meaningful upgrades that actually make an impact on gameplay.
- Shooting Mechanics: Fun, smooth, and weighty shooting that makes combat feel satisfying.

++The Bad++

- Optimization Issues: Performance could be better; it’s not as smooth as it should be.
- AI Issues: The persistent AI is currently turned off, affecting immersion.
- Shader Compiling: The game compiles shaders each time it’s launched, which is time-consuming and detracts from the experience.

++ Should You Buy++

If you’re a fan of the previous Stalker games, I highly recommend picking this one up. You’ll be familiar with the usual Stalker jank, and I’m sure the devs will iron out the issues soon.

For newcomers who enjoy dystopian shooters, there's a solid game here, though it's hidden behind a few fundamental flaws. If you're unsure, I’d suggest playing the earlier Stalker games to get a better sense of the series. Otherwise I would hold off for a while until a later patch fix. 

++Disclaimer++
As a huge Stalker fan, I’ve tried to remain as unbiased as possible in this review.

HDR (Black Point / Nits etc) doesn't give you a test screen, so good luck setting up HDR properly.

"As a huge stalker fan since release of trilogy i have to say ive been waiting for this game to come out for more than a decade so when it finally came out i was in heaven. But in a matter of hours ive been brought back to earth. This game as for now is not a stalker game. It is mediocre shooter game like any other. There is hardly any pros i can think of, except for better graphics.. Atmosphere is gone, this feeling of dread, unease and mystery. Encounters with bloodsucker which are still very scary for me in trilogy, here are absolutely dull and just annoying as every enemy absorbs huge ammounts of bullets before it dies, not even mentioning that there is no wounded status like in call of pripyat(!!). AI is non-existent, enemies spawn meters from you, not actually traveling the world like before. You spend all the money you made last hour to fix your goddamn rifle because after few hits it is half broken. Story? After several hours i dont even remember what am i supposed to do because it is just not interesting. I heard game has lots of performance issues and bugs, didnt really encountered any bigger issues with that myself so i cant complain about that. Ahh, that game is the biggest disappointment since long time for me. I believe it can still be fixed but i would not raise my hopes too high. Honestly, go play chernobylite or metro instead.",negative
"Having finished the game a while back and had time to process what I think of it, I think I'm ready to write a review. Overall, as a huge fan of the original three games, I think I still really love STALKER 2.

STALKER 2 is a hot mess. 

It's not even just in terms of technical issues, but in terms of design and story and even the world and the content within it. There's plenty of things that- regardless of how ""minor"" they are- sure as hell made the original three games feel a lot more unique and ironically more like living open worlds despite their map-based nature than many modern open world games, including some of the darlings people praise to hell and back years later. STALKER 2 is missing basically all of these, as of now. 

The A-Life is currently busted (???) because they had to basically nuke its functionality to make UE5 actually run at just high enough of a framerate for frame generation to actually work correctly (God help you if you aren't using the latest and greatest and wish to run it without framegen) as UE5 itself is more of a hellscape than The Zone itself could ever be. The enemy AI (1.2 is out mere days after I wrote this so uh... will edit after I play it a bit?) embodies, in the worst way possible, every STALKER AI meme you've heard or seen in your entire life, veering between braindead and rapid-fire sniping you through 10 different bushes in a row while your own bullets seemingly get stopped by the 2nd bush if you're lucky. The overall design of the world makes me miss when they just had separate maps that, as a point of fact, actually mostly had their own unique feels and layouts to them which made them more interesting than what we actually have in S2. Exploring the entire map, conversely, feels like a good way to learn to despise the game outright because of how pointless it is to actually do this- at least for loot, anyways, although selling the thousands of excess bandages and medkits is a good way to make money at least which is nice given how swapping to Coupons instead of using Rubles apparently nuked the entire economic stability of The Zone for some reason. The story veers between padding, fanservice, fanservice that pisses the fans off, and actually being genuinely interesting and this constantly swinging pendulum it has going on feels increasingly schizophrenic the more I've thought about it. The English VA is bad.

Yet, I still adore it. I can't say it's my favorite one, as that weirdo who has a hateboner for CoP these days and really did think SoC and CS were actually his favorite ones, it's somewhere well above CoP for me while never quite hitting the magic the first two had for me. It still, in spite of all the shit it's missing, has that atmosphere and general feel that I've really, *really* needed in recent years, the music while also something of a mixed bag for me- the ambient tracks are wonderful, the more ""cinematic"" stuff makes me cringe a bit- still hits me hard when it hits. Even as needlessly big as the map is and how scarce actual side content is after a point I still actually really think exploring the map is fun in STALKER 2. Even as much of a meme as the AI is, I actually still think combat is pretty fun. Even as much of a mistake as UE5 is, the game still actually looks pretty good for the most part. Even as broken as it is- well, I liked Clear Sky, I don't think that's something I'm prone to even care about by then.

Even if it's a shittier version of STALKER, I still think it's a STALKER game and not actually even a bad one despite having a *ton* of issues, same as I think CoP and, God, even the Anomaly mod as much as I shit on it is still technically STALKER enough that I still try to play it from time to time at least. It just could have and really should have been so much better, even then.

(Addendum: I'm blind as fuck, non-essential non-scripted wounded NPCs still seem to actually be a thing. Corrected that part by straight up taking it out of the initial text, but for transparency's sake, let it be said I'm a dumbass lmao)

"WARNING: I DO NOT  KNOW HOW TO WRITE A REVIEW OR HAVE MUCH EXPERIENCE BUT

TLDR: Game good, Buy if interested

I had to write one for this game. 

 For a while, I've been craving a survival type experience game closer to metro (not in any way like rust or ark)   . Ive played the metro games including the vr one and loved the atmosphere, game mechanics, and story. Some of these games have been the best immersive experience for me. I hadn't really had any experience with the Stalker Franchise until I started this one (I have one of the older stalker games but i played it for 5 min, like a day before stalker 2 to understand what im buying into. 

      My first 10 hours of the game was being a goddamn tourist, taking screenshots of the weather change, lightning striking with small jolts coming off the lightning bolts as it stabs into the ground with a loud BOOMing noise from the dark greenish skies, with rain flooding down the grey clouds, then later when its quiet and still, the force pure  energetic rage of the zone that is the emission. After I was done getting mesmerized by the weather channel and more of the beauty of the zone, I was getting my ___ pounded by swarms of rats, zombies leap frogging and the Bloodsuckers..... The amount of times those bloodsuckers just snuck on me has had me paranoid in dark areas. There are even more mutants that I dont want to spoil cause you wont believe me if I described them here.
        
          The gun-play feels good and so does hitting your head-shots, you feel that bullet going through that skull when you hit em.  (Random Tip: ALWAYS HAVE ENOUGH SUPPLIES FOR A FULL FIGHT, ALWAYS). Different variety of guns to choose from, with a visual design showing you the weight in some of those guns when you pull them out of the recoil from them. Audio design sounds great as well for alot of these weapons ( havent used them all), offering different playstyles and a upgrade system allowing you to make your weapons deadlier and easier to carry.
         The Story, I'll be honest I was lost at times because I was too busy going around the map and exploring a lot of areas with a ""?"" on them. Some of these places are gonna be locked or have a puzzle that you need to figure out through the enviroment or exploring the area. The map itself is huge and since there is no fast travel you will be walking/slugging/running everywhere which is ggood and bad. 


         Games like Dragons dogma offer that idea of wandering everywhere  instead of fast travelling for a more immersive experience with things to do in between. Stalker 2 is amazing in the sense there are SO many places to explore and even smaller places on the map where they wont mark with unique loot pushing the player to be curious. Now my only problem with this is sometimes that walk to the mission or area is a LONG one. Maybe not empty (with random encounters: hostile, friendly, random events, weather channel stuff), but yet i find myself bored at times just going striaght from  mission to mission. My recommendation to you is dont rush to do the story unless you really are curious but DONT FORGET ABOUT THE SIDEQUESTS. Some of these side quests were more fleshed out than I thought with a twist here and there with permenant decisions that can affect the future of your game play. Not just in the side quests but in the main story as well. on Record I have 120 hrs and Im still not done. 


Now for the insects

        At launch the game was really buggy but for me (crashes, main mission bugs, enemy tposing in place and not doing anything, texture/frame flickers) it wasnt at the level of cyberpunk but for a game at 60$ on launch was kind of unacceptable. Since then theye done a great job with optimization fixes and bug fixes (there are still more they need to flatten out but if you are itching to get the game and you can wait I would recoomend that but if you dont want to, right now is still pretty good if your pc can handle it)

I just hope, (probably never gonna happen) that we get some sort of vr mod or vr port cause this game would be amazing. (Yes I know Into the Raduis 2 is out but it is still in EA and I got no one to partner up with)

"Disclaimer: I'm a huge fan of the original STALKER series.

Is it janky? Yep! Is the voice acting bad? Yep! Does it have bugs and performance issues? Yep! 

But... in the few months its been out it has become significantly more stable. I'm willing to give the developers time considering they're in a country that is in the middle of a war and considering that its amazing they've been able to release anything at all. 

STALKER 2 has amazing moments. Like, when you are walking towards your goal and find yourself suddenly in the middle of two opposing groups battling it out. Or when you lure a mutant that is hunting you into an use a anomaly to trap it. The combat is honestly really fun and satisfying. 

Another major plus in this games favor is the modding community. For the modding community alone this game is worth it. I have faith that the developers will continue to refine this game and improve it but if they don't I know the modders will. 

The STALKER series was never polished or perfect, but the atmosphere is unmatched. Go into this knowing that the game is a rough diamond. Its not finished and might never be to AAA standards of polish, but its still a diamond.",positive

Stop the cap, the game isn't so good, like everybody says. And I forgot the crappy performance and the random crashes, like bro the game is out like 3 months and it's still not good.",negative

It leave alot to be desired....that being said its a great game. If you can handle the frequent crashing and a world full of wasted potential. any i give it a 6 out of 10. If you like games like uncharted and dying light then youll like this game.,positive
"The Good:
The game is gorgeous and takes every turn it can seemingly to nod to the original games, and it's a treat to explore areas both new and old to the series. Equipment feels suitably valuable, and I'm often as glad to find attachments as I am weapons or a suit.
I am pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable the story is, but it does also just feel like an excuse to guide the player through an intended route of progression both in terms of the player's equipment and the locations they've visited. 

The Bad:
There's an unfortunate amount of enemy encounters that simply spawn in whenever you open a bag, enter a building, do x, that AREN'T quest relevant. As of my review, there's still no hint of an A-life system like previous games had, and quest encounters and random encounters both can bug out when NPCs get drawn into a gunfight with local mutants. The game does a really unfortunate and boring thing where it spawns in two opposing factions' squads some distance from the player, and if the player or a mutant doesn't intervene, they take a while to die and just kind of clutter up the game space. *And it's not super valuable to intervene, because even later in the game, these enemies will have broken or damaged early game equipment and almost no relevant loot.*

"Like so many others, I have waited over a decade for this game to come out. I've sunk countless hours into the original 3 games, seen the movie, read A Roadside Picnic. I love this game, it gets a lot of things great from the previous games, especially the atmosphere, exploration. etc. I know I'll sink many hours into it still. 

I do have several gripes. 

- Medical supplies are a dime a dozen and can be found in so many places, even on the hardest difficulty. 

- Enemies still have hit-scan/laser accuracy (I hope this to be fixed in the future)

- Artifacts no longer have specific numbers attached to their buffs and debuffs, just weak/medium/strong/max. I would rather see specific numbers. They also have a ""max effect"" meaning you can only stack effects so far, which sort of shoehorns the player into a very generic ""one of each"" type of build. No more stacking weight artifacts or stamina ones, and the stamina system kinda sucks for that. 


- The gunplay is a massive step up, however its kinda ass when enemies can tank shots to the head with rifles. Similarly, with maxed armor and a good artifact, I don't find myself really challenged at the high difficulty. I can spam medkits and just sponge damage because nothing but the gauss rifle kills very fast, and I'd rather the time to kill both enemies and the player be more akin to previous titles. It doesn't feel as tactical because of this. If the player and enemies are bullet sponges, it doesn't feel very satisfying. Perhaps if we do see a master difficulty, it will be more akin to the original 3 titles. 

-Repair economy still feels sort of ass, if only from the perspective it encourages pack-mule gameplay of hoarding and selling guns. I'd rather get coupons from missions and artifacts than dumping yellow durability guns on a trader. 

-Side missions feel sort of scattered and few, though I'm sure we will see more with patches and future content. 

I know I echo a lot of the community in these thoughts, and I'm sure future patches will address a lot as well. I applaud GSC Game World in their efforts, past, present, and future.

"I've finished my first playthrough a couple of weeks ago now and feel like S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2 is a difficult masterpiece. 

Despite the gigantic issues that this game has, I have really enjoyed the story and immersion the game has kept from the original trilogy. It feels like the most we could have asked from the developers as a community and fanbase. At times I did encounter major bugs and I will say that the unbearably long shader-compilation times did hold back my overall enjoyment for the game as a whole but if we put them to a side for the story then it feels really good and there is huge developments to be had for the lore of S.T.A.L.K.E.R and the Zone here. So much has changed and yet so little is different. Skif, the protagonist of HoC feels like an interesting character and it will be interesting to see if he appears in the future DLCs that the game will receive. May I add that I am super excited for them and can't wait to get stuck back in when more polishing is done to the game.

Would I push for someone to buy HoC right now?
I'd say hold off for a while until GSC delivers the big updates to address the pressing issues the game faces.

Current release: a glorified fallout 4 mod with bugs, OP MFking Bloodsuckers, and a bruh moment of where is the content. 5/10.",negative
"Overall I will say the Positives and Negatives

Positive:
Gameplay is really good not gonna lie, especially the weapons making it feel realistic and dynamic. Graphics is also stunning and captivating (though it has downsides). large scale map making it (almost) fully explorable with each location being unique from one another. Gun upgrades and attachments giving weapons alot of customization ability. Story is interesting, alot of it linking to the first S.T.A.L.K.E.R series.

Negative:
Streight up the main biggest issue is the dam frame drops, it gets so annoying to the point that the game is unplayable at times even with the help of mods (-50 FPS) to the point you can see a slight delay in the movement and actions. Another thing is the dam enemies, sure they are unique but I literally cannot tell who's friendly and who's enemy from a distance ALSO the number of enemies that constantly spawn non-stop (in certain areas) giving maybe a 2 minute break before going back into battle again. Some areas are so dam dark and practically impossible to see 5 metres infront of you and at the same time constantly being shot at from the dark by a dam enemy. (theres a few more stuff but these are the main problems)

Overall:
Gameplay is good, but horrible with the frame rate and constant enemy encounters, I don't recommend getting this game in the state as it is in currently. As for now I'd wait for a FPS update then maybe reconsider trying it.",negative

"Still a noob. Heard White Ward come on the radio. Had to stand in front of the radio for thirteen minutes to hear the entirety of Leviathan. A good game includes Ukrainian black metal. 10/10 would stand in base listening again!

Edit 1: (Many more hours of gameplay later) Devs released a huge update today fixing a lot of bugs encountered by players and improving AI behavior. I've noticed many things about the game that seem unfinished or rushed, like many players have expressed before me. I do feel like I paid $60 to be a beta tester. I understand the difficulties of the dev team being small and in a country experiencing active conflict, but I still feel a little disappointed that I needed to download over a dozen mods to make the game more enjoyable (and even playable). 

S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2 is a WONDERFUL game, coming from a young man who grew up playing the Fallout titles. It does need more polishing. I hope that the devs continue to work on making this game a GEM in recent video gaming history and the best S.T.A.L.K.E.R game to date. Keep up the good work, gang, and listen to your player base.

Edit 2: I've recently entered into Prypiat, but cannot progress in the area since I've encountered several memory leaks which completely locks the game up and will not unlock my computer until I have the task manager manually end the task. I'm contemplating changing my recommendation to ""No"" since there are a number of game breaking bugs I've encountered that have completely halted my progression.

Edit 3: Constant memory leaks. Cannot say I would recommend the game to anyone right now considering it continuously crashes. GSC needs to make sure their games work before they decide to go through with publishing. ",negative
"Stalker 2's got problems on problems on problems. If you can come up with a glitch or crash cause or possible reason for a game to suddenly start running like crap out of nowhere, they've already got you beat to it. Just this morning I was in an elevator going up to an area I assumed would open directly to a bunch of fighting, so I was angled in the corner, aiming down my sights ready to shoot whoever I saw, and then suddenly I was clipping through the elevator floor and falling to my death. Something about the combination of doing those things while the game was trying to take me up somewhere, couldn't handle it.

The game struggles when there's a bunch of NPCs around you, because the character behavior programming is apparently so CPU-intensive that it noticeably struggles whenever you're in a town of any kind. And the character behavior is not impressive, it's not like they've each got unique programming levels and they can all be interacted with like a full and believable human being, you can't even directly speak to 4/5ths of any given group of people because they all tell you to ""speak to the man in charge"" of their group, and then when you do that all you can do is have them deliver a single line of irrelevant flavor dialogue about the zone or ""trade"", and they all have a single food item and a little bit of ammo and a medkit and 700 bucks and they won't accept any item you actually want to sell. So what that programming is actually doing in the background that causes it to struggle so much is basically anyone's guess.

I just beat a mission this morning where some enemies attacked an allied building, and I had to fight them off, and it spawned two of them in a location that the game forgot to unlist as ""everyone in here is in the Scientists faction"" which it had to do since the whole area used to be considered a ""town area"" where you couldn't even unholster your gun, so when you kill those two guys you get a message telling you you completed the mission, and then another message telling you the Scientists are afraid of you now because you killed some of their people. When I was in fact saving them in a mission the game told me to do.

In almost any aspect of the game, there is a problem. The mutants are not enjoyable to fight against, because they behave as though you have a dodge button. You do not. So when they leap at you from twenty feet away or run up next to you and then knock you down, it feels bad. You can stand on a car or anything and their AI will break and they'll try to hide behind cover somewhere because they don't know how to get to you, so that's what you do to fight every monster. It is not enjoyable. The humans are not enjoyable to fight against, because they will suddenly spawn in a whole squad of dudes at random and they'll all know where you are and start shooting at you immediately, and they all have aimbot. It is not enjoyable.

It might sound like I really hate the game; and I kinda do, in its current state! And yet I continue playing it. I don't know that I've ever worked this hard to fiddle with settings and get mods to make a game more endurable in my entire life, because I want it to work. I want to be able to play it. People will mod this into a fully appreciable game someday. I just wanna plink dudes in the head and navigate anomalies and find artifacts and sell shit and listen to sad Ukrainian women singing on the radio. Someday this will be that game, just like the first and third games eventually were.",negative

"The game itself is fun but riddled with problems- give it a try when it goes on sale. If you haven't played previous Stalker titles or enjoy more fast-paced games, this is NOT IT; go try Stalker Anomaly, a highly rated + free Stalker standalone game/mod. 

My general issues with the game are as follows:

You will take 20-60 minutes to fully explore minor locations, then spend 10-15 minutes hiking your loot back to the nearest town and sell it (as you are heavy and slow), just to need 5-10x the money you just made to repair your guns you had to use to protect yourself along the way. I can't speak to the late game economy, but in the early game, it's either a walking simulator, or you're perpetually dirt poor. Due to repair costs, it's almost more economical to just let your gear degrade, and hope you loot another full durability one. Even if you treat it as a loot cart walking sim, you will still be struggling with money on top having spend an inane amount of time traveling.

There's also <10 fast travel points across the entire map with a less than ideal layout, overall leading to a significant amount of time spent walking, even if you aren't hauling a heavy inventory of loot. Walking with the occasional random combat or anomaly on the road is fine at first, but once you get a grasp of how truly large the map is, and how much you are made to run around, it gets old very fast. Many Stalker fans online will simply tell you that you don't truly enjoy the game and are just trying to 'load in and do missions and leave'.

I think that this game is much better enjoyed if you focus on the quests/atmosphere solely and install mods to fix some of the issues (repair/sell economy, AI, weight balances, etc.) or the 'fun' as Reddit seems to call it... 

AI Issues:
- AI spots you instantly, through brush always, through walls or hilltops often, 50-100m out while crouching; it doesn't matter. Stealth is not possible vanilla and iffy at best with mods.
- AI will infinitely pepper you with shots at any distance with 100% accuracy (this is not an exaggeration made out of frustration, they quite literally will not miss). There's cover to hide behind when you're close and the bullets don't do much damage super far away, but the constant hits, bleed, and general immersion breaking are pretty annoying. Mods exist to alter this, but don't expect perfection, and do expect crashes slightly more often.
- AI spawns in nearly in front of you and just immediately starts fighting (or whatever other scripted thing is going on). This game doesn't have persistent NPCs like prior games in the series. Mods exist to alter this (only to modify spawning behavior to try and better 'mirror' what the world felt like in previous titles).

Graphics/Performance:
- Hands down the hardest game to run I have played to date (and one of the best looking, to be fair). I have a 4070, i7-13700k, 32gb 7200MHz DDR6, and struggle to get more than 80-90fps avg @ 1080p on High preset. With DLSS upscaling (DLAA quality) + frame gen on the same high preset, you're looking at a maybe 10 frames or so more. For any 144hz 1080p users (or higher res/refresh rate) you are pretty much fucked.

If you're willing to put up with the super slow pace, AI issues, and the game not being optimized the best, it's pretty fun and cool, and the map is a spectacle if you're at all interested in Soviet History, post-apocalyptic environments and scenery, and/or brutalist architecture. More than half of the enjoyment for me in this game is just seeing the map and all the cool stuff they've shoved into it.",positive
"Погрався годин 5. Враження не дуже... Може через рочок попатчать і буде ок, але поки отримувати від неї задоволення не виходить.
 1) озвучка... українська озвучка не сподобалася. Основні персонажі озвучені так театрально, що втрачається занурення. Дикторські голоси, паузи між словами, оце все, а не жива мова. При тому текст хороший. Але відчуття що тобі вірш читають а не вояка дає квест. До речі те ж саме відчуття театральщини було в Metro2033. ХЗ хто винен, актори озвучки чи замовники так хотіли, але ж якось вдається нормально озвучувати серіали і фільми, так що в них мова звучить живою, а тут не вийшло.
 2) Живучість монстрів. Це абсолютна срака, але думаю(надіюся) пофіксять. Щоб убити сраного кровососа потрібно в нього з дробовика десь раз 20 влучити. Тобто зробити це ""по чесному"" неможливо.
 3) нема сенсу мочити монстрів. На них витрачається дочорта дорогоцінних патронів, але в винагороду ти отримуєш... нічого не отримуєш. Знаково що тут же модороби випустили мод що додає лут з монстрів як в попередніх частинах і він дуже популярний. Надіюся це прикрутять нативно, бо особисто для мене полювання на монстрів було однією з улюблених розваг.
 4) Alife2 (і його відсутність) вже купу понаписували про це. До того ж повторюся, життя монстрів на природі тебе не сильно хвилює, адже найкраща стратегія - від них з*єбатися, бо сенсу вступати в бій нема.

"Not sure if i can recommend this right now, if you love stalker you will love this game guaranteed.
However this game feels unfinished which is odd considering how long they postponed launch.
the combat is often lackluster and frustrating in parts, the anomaly searching is good and fun, the dialogue is amazing and engaging in most cases including side missions which don't seem to give you a lot of anything which makes me not want to even engage in them.

Right now I'm on my second play-through of three that I'm going to do and i feel it is missing a ton of quality of life things, now to mention the way this game runs...
this is one of the worst running games i have ever seen, simply will not run correctly on whatever i put it one at some points, memory leaks in outposts is bizarre and seems incredibly avoidable. there is a boss fight where on my first run i had an old graphics card, some parts including this fight hit a crisp 5 FPS, this is absurd when i would get 40 fps in other areas.
now on my second play-through on  a more powerful card i got 20-30 without cranking the setting to as low as they would go and still didn't get past 70.

this and a lot of other issues seem inexcusable in major opinion of many players. 
do your research check what you like and what you don't this game has problems like the other stalker games if you aren't ready for a couple of bugs and issues then i don't recommend Any Stalker game.
that's what makes them fun and quirky.",positive

"After +100 hours of farming,shooting the non-existent AI life and fighting the bugs in this game the zone finally catched me

I can't progress anymore on the campaign due a bug in a main quest , Tried everything to solve it and i don't think is cool to install a external dev tool to hotfix this

Loading old saves doesn't fix anything,and at this state I'd rather leave the game until the team solves this problems
I tought giving months and wait for patches should be the better way to play this game (Nope.)

Being a fan of the franchise and know how to quick save everytime ,even the small issue
But you can't sell something at $60 and pray that doens't bug at 10/20/30/ +40 hours,especially not even your main material, the campaign

I totally understand the nightmare situation that the team of this video game went through and continues to go through to date today
But I would rather delay the product than release it at this state,It looks like every company makes this pratice very common

We are currently at 150 GB required and it feels like day one product
How is even possible to launch a new patch without the main issues of the game that doesn't allow to progress through the campaign?

I think thats the main reason only a small percentage of players have the ""Campaign finished"" Achievement 

I hope that in a few months (Hope so) or years (Hope not) this game can be played without problems ,I suggest to play the main trilogy and GAMMA instead until this gets polished. Is just matter of time to be a great game

Just remember,the people saw the redemption of a notorious game involving the future...
I really enjoyed the game and it was ""worth it""...Don't give up , Fix the game and you will see how the positive reviews go up",positive
"Not recommended in its current state.
Clearly not a finished product as devs have confirmed their Ai system is only half baked. They have updated it partially. more to come later this year?

Random crashes I don't experience in other games.
Poor performance on a 4080 super. Needs every fake frame tool in existence to run 'good'.

Will try out game again when they drop big patches.

"I can't for the life of me understand why games are released in such a state and get great reviews when they are literally unplayable or have game breaking bugs that requires dev commands to get past things. Stalker 2 just feels like a COMPLETE slog of a game. It feels like a chore. I played it on normal difficulty and if I wasn't having to battle frame rate drops and other weird glitches, I was being punished by what the game developers thought were great game mechanics that limit the player or make you regret your initial decision by the choices you made in the game. There are issues not addressed with Stalker 2 and the devs just seem to not even care or tiptoe around the issue entirely. The initial impression was that it was going to be enjoyable. The more I played it, the more aggravated I became. Enemies in their game are either one attack from you being killed or such a bullet sponge that you waste the entirety of the ammo you found that took a good hour or more to acquire. The traversal in this game makes me want to shoot my dick off with a shotgun. Who the hell thought it was such a good idea to trade and wade through swamps and just get stuck in the mud where you can't even move. The real big issue with Stalker 2 is Unreal Engine 5. The engine is so poorly optimized. Cut scenes should NOT be dropping below 40 FPS with an RTX 3080 and 5800X. I can't recommend this game. If not for purchasing from a third party vendor to get this game lower than retail, i'd demand a refund. I can honestly give this game a 5/10. It's just a broken mess plagued by optimization issues and bad game engine that holds it back from advancing to a great potential, whereever that may be.",negative

"To preface, I'm not part of the STALKER cult. That is to say, my opinion towards this game is without a single ounce of rose colour tinted glasses.

Now that's out of the way...
Look, I think the game is... Decent. It's a lot more flexible, and a lot more ""open world"" than Metro series. It's more in line of a -pick your adventure- type experience. If you're looking for a Metro atmospheric + Fallout roam and quest, this would be your bag.

Unfortunately, the con.
The optimisation is... God. Good god. Oh god.
i7-9700 / RTX 3060. I've installed an optimisation patch from Nexus, I've tuned down graphics... Still, an insane amount of enjoyment is taken away from me due to the performance issue.

That aside. What's with the weather? Day / Night cycle feels like 10% day 90% night, and 10% of the day is either storming, or cloudy. I'm not looking for sunshine 24/7, but I'm definitely not liking this Britain weather simulator. And the flash light is so weak, I continously contemplate if I should just turn it off and try to adjust to the darkness.

Spent $170 CAD on this, I hope to FFFFFFF they'll push out a half way decent optimisation patch soon.",negative

Only had a few technical issues, but nothing unusual for a game of such scale and depth so early in release. If you are on the fence and have a decent computer buy it.

"Stalker 2 is a great follow up to the previous games. In my opinion the devs got it right, but as of writing this it's far from perfect. There are enough quests main and side, to keep you busy for quite some time and the game world is quite large, However as of patch 1.1.4 there are still many bugs, sometimes immersion breaking or just annoying. They have work to do for sure.
I'm still glad I played through to the end and I enjoyed most of it and for Stalker fans well, you just have to play it.",positive
"While this game is still very buggy, it is no longer an unplayable mess after patch 1.2.   The story and atmosphere of this game is excellent but the game mechanics and immersion breaking bugs let it down.  This game feels like it could be one of the best games in the last several years with some content updates and some polish.  Just know that buying this game in many ways it is like buying an early release of the game, supporting the game studio so they (hopefully) deliver the experience that this game promises to be.",positive

"I wanted to write a review after getting all achievements but after over 130 hours I just decided to stop trying. Overall the game is quite good, it's a lot of fun, but I wanna mention a few things which could be done better and yes there is a lot, because this game needs a lot of work which is kinda sad, I would have really hoped for this game to be more polished and a bit more like the old games, like an extension of the franchise instead of a new take on it with a modern standard formula.
(This review was supposed to be longer, but Steam doesn't allow it)

-World and Atmosphere-
The world looks good, it really does, but it is too big, travelling can be a pain, especially if you are in the swamps or have to walk around those hills with steep walls, buttes, mesas or whatever you call them. The design is also sometimes not too interesting, I have to admit that after a while the woods and grass lands just all look the same, because there is so much of them and reaching Prypiat was actually kinda dissapointing, I had expected a bit more, I know everything being gray is most likely quite realistic but it felt empty and it's design was mostly a bit sad. But on a small scale like if you just look at the water, the walls and the flora everywhere it's beautiful, just amazing. It's just lacking a bit of that macroscopical design.

-Gunplay-
Th gunplay is alright my aim is quite bad so I can't really tell, but sometimes it does feel a bit funky when you get hit over 100 metres and your head starts to shake, making it quite hard to hit something. Overall no big complaints here.

-Story, Factions and Downgrades from the old games-
There is a story, a quite long and excessive one at that, I was kinda impressed but also confused by the voice acting which was very minimal in the old games. In a way I like it, I enjoyed most of the cutscenes and the little lore bits. The story overall was really good, but also confusing from time to time, I sometimes didn't really know what I was doing or what I was doing it for and the story summaries in the pda are very very basic.
A lot of the games story focusses around the factions and your affiliation with them and there are way too many opportiunities to side with a faction, you don't ever get punished for siding against them. In one story mission I decided to fight with faction A against B and later on still worked with B together, nobody cared that I killed their men. But when you accidently kill one of your guys in a fight, the faction if it is not story relevant (I think) will get hostile immediately and befrieding them again is apparently possible but I don't know how, as they had no leader. You can also not join factions like you could in the old games for some reason just like you don't have your spying glasses or night vision anymore or how you can't see an AIs name, friendliness/hostility and it's affiliation anymore when you look at them, like seriously where are those very basic features? Factions therefore also clearly lack flavor when it comes to story telling, they did it all through the games story and those little notes you get in loading screens (which dissapear too quick by the way), but not all factions are represented in the story. Quite often I can't even tell who is shooting at me or who I am talking to, because there is no way to identify the people besides the suites they're wearing and even then I don't know anything about them.

-Artifacts-
There are way too many artifacts in the game and a lot of them don't have any significant usability. You can find any artifact anywhere in the according anomaly, so progressing through the game there will be no rarer artifacts. Finding legendary artifacts is actually a lot easier than finding common ones, I still don't have all and the only ones missing are apparently common or maybe rare, I technically own all but in seperate runs and that doesn't count. I don't understand how it is possible that after some 10-20 hours or so of artifact hunting I am still missing the most basic ones while having seen hundreds of Hypercubes and Liquid Rocks which have insane stats and are supposed to be super rare, there is apparently a moment in the game where rarities are changed, but I couldn't really tell in my second run if that is actually true. In my second run I was again missing only like 5 artifacts, but after hours and hours of searching I just stopped and quitted the 100% run.

-Enemies and Economy-
One of the worst parts about the game and one of the most significant ones at that is the enonomy and enemy AI which are both seperate problems and together create one big problem. I mean restocking all your stuff and repairing your gear can cost you anything between a few thousand dollars with crap gear and 100k+. Now that wouldn't be a problem if you wouldn't use so much ammo and if your weapons wouldn't loose so much condition, but exactly this is where the enemy problem comes in, enemies tank way too much and there are way too many enemies, because they always respawn and attack you. There are too many hostile and tanky mutants and a lot of scripted encounters which don't really add anything interesting to the game and are just annoying. This game clearly didn't deliver on the ALIFE promise the developers made. The human enemies quite often don't even have to really see you, over distance enemies can spot and shoot you without you being able to see them, they can shoot you through grass and bushes, but close range they can't even see you if you stand in front of them. Another problem is that the same types of enemies just like artifacts can also be found everywhere, so if you are in a 60-80 hour run and you reach the end game there is nothing new for you to fight, just the same old enemies, with the exception, that you will most likely encounter different factions. Friendly AI also tends to shoot you a lot.

-Menus-
I hate the games menus with passion, everytime I press escape and wanna save or reload I have to click multiple times so the game reacts, because the menu doesn't immediately react to your inputs after you open it. And in game as well the pda really sucks. If you complete a mission you will get a little orange dot as a notification in the missions tab, to get rid of it you will have to view the mission in the completed missions tab, but most of the newly completed missions are moved to the very bottom of the list, so you have to scroll all the way or atleast almost all the way down and scrolling in the pda is very painful.

-Bugs and game size-
There are multiple bugs I like to note:
-AI despawning while still being shown on the map, happened to me with a guide
-AI just despawning in general
-Side missions from enemies being shown as available on the map
-Artifacts getting stuck in the floor or objects
-Endless rain but no emissions
-The game doesn't compile the shaders properly anymore after the last updates, it just crashes (this should be fixed by now, but I still crash the game iintentionally because it is much faster than waiting for the shaders to compile)
-Being able to fast travel to hostile faction headquarters, eventhough I enjoy that one, because it makes life easier. But I would rather befriend the faction again, no idea how (I am pretty sure that it is not story related but rather I accidently shot one of their men in a fight)
-Being unable to move the map from time to time

And I wanna mention the game size and the size of updates, which are just ridiculous. The game is some 180gb and the first update was 110gb. One hundred and ten gigabytes for an update is insane, no matter it's content.

Overall I don't know if you should buy the game you have to decide for yourself, I'd give it like an 8/10 eventhough it might not sound like it from the review, but I did really enjoy it, especially if you just focus on the story and have fun instead of going for achievements.",positive

"Enjoyed every moment playing this game.  With a few graphics tweaks to add more fidelity, it looked amazing, and if you swap DLSS .dll files to the new DLSS 4 with Preset K, the game looks so crisp on DLAA!!!

Looks aside, it was an enjoyable experience.  The devs squashed a lot of bugs up front, and other than one side mission that caused me issues from a bug (I was able to work around it via internet searching), I did not personally run into any other game breaking issues, crashes or bugs (must have been lucky from what I read online?).

Lots to explore in the Zone, so while the walking can be tedious, I did run into a lot of neat things along the way and found some great loot to help me through the main story line.  Toward the end, I just started to fast travel everywhere, as at that point, credits were no longer an issue.

After waiting so long from the original games, this was a very welcome gaming experience.

Hats off to the dev team too considering their situation during development.",positive
This is pretty disappointing. The core mechanic of the STALKER games is absent here in the scope it was in their first 3 games. It feels awful to play by comparison.,negative
"I finished the game, but close to the end it was an absolute slog to get through. The game really should have been about 15 hours shorter that it was. I did about 50% of the side quests I was given and they were ok. The combat is fine, but just fine. The story is difficult to follow even though I know the story of the first game. I will say that the game does have a unique atmosphere and cool anomaly mechanics that are not seen elsewhere. I just wish the anomalies were not so copy and paste all the time. I would give this game a 7/10 with a ""i'm not going through that ever again"".",negative

"After playing all previous Stalker games as well as many of the mods this came as a bit of a letdown to me. I did get many happy hours of playtime but I had more fun in OGSR and that is ""free"". I found the plot nonsensical, overly long and none of my choices seemed rational or consistent with the character or situation. If you are a Stalker fan then it's worth playing for the nostalgia and atmosphere alone but I would recommend holding off till most of the bugs are squashed.",positive

"this game is still a scam, looks and feels worse than newer games that took less time to create, was playable for a while, i have minimum requirements but the updates started getting me stuck and crashing the game on loading shaders, they made the optimization and loadings intentionally dumb so that you waste alot of time on that and are unable to get a refund. early release state marketed as fully working game... modders dont want to work on it either most likely cause of the constant small and garbage mostly updates from the developers, only thing to be done is give it some time but pretty hopeless at this point.",negative
"been softlocked for 2 months, no word from the devs. Save yourself the money and just crack the game.",negative
very good game!,positive
"I'd rather say I'm mixed on this game. It does a bunch of things well, but then it does other things that pull it back down again. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed my time with it. A lot of HoC hearkens back to my first time playing the other games when I was younger. The game is really pretty to wander around in. Visual and sound design is great and it makes the Zone feel alive.

At the same time, the way the AI, encounters and quest design work takes away from that experience. Initially, this has been patched now, the game spawned in enemies/allies encountered in the wild in a small radius around you. This means you could look one way first, another the second and all of a sudden a bandit deathsquad has formed behind you blasting your butt out of nowhere. This has been remedied now and it has helped feel random encounters feel a lot less stiff.

Exploration and the way quests work are seemingly in some sort of a tug-of-war. The first thing I did when I got some decent gear was to try and find some memorable places from the old games. Some of these are tied to story-related events. One particular instance got me softlocked in the Agroprom Underground. This area is (yet shouldn't be) accessible while exploring. I managed to get in through an open hole in one of the air vents connected to the tunnels. The tunnels felt strangely empty and it was until I realised all exits were blocked that I wasn't supposed to be here... yet. This is just an example, but this ""Oh I shouldn't be here yet"" experience continued throughout most of my playthrough.

The points I mentioned above were most common during my playtime. If you play this game as a more linear, story-driven experience with the open world being a break from the action, you'll probably enjoy it. As a fan of the older games, I do think it's worth the price. Even if it's just to experience the Zone in such fidelity.",positive
i feel like a true slav after playing this,positive
Maybe the shining zone was the friends we made along the way,positive
"It's great! I replayed the first and third games to prepare for Stalker 2, and it's faithful to the originals! I would say, my biggest complaint is the loading screens requiring input to progress. It's so obnoxious. I'd say a third of my playtime is just sitting at fully loaded sections that require me to arbitrarily press a button for no reason. You start the game, it loads. Press a button. You select continue, it loads, press a button. It's completely arbitrary and obnoxious, and I can only assume it's done to artificially inflate playtime to reduce refunds, but it's still worth it in the end.",positive
"111 hours of playtime and counting. I haven't played such an immersive and fun game in many years. The exploration aspect is excellent, the open world around you is beautiful, and the ambiance is hauntingly atmospheric - getting caught in a blood-red sky emission and running for shelter gives the same adrenaline rush and sense of danger every time! I also enjoy unlocking the fun Steam achievements - some of which are missable. Haven't even finished the main questline yet, as I'm trying to explore everything, hunting for artifacts, collecting all the available gear, unique ""named"" weapons & attachments and I'm taking the quests slow - basically aiming for a ""completionist"" playthrough. Kudos to GSC Game World!",positive
"good game, didn't play the first few but it didn't matter",positive
"I genuinely want to recommend this game, but I can't. The weapon balancing is currently trash, stealth barely works, NPCs throw a dozen grenades at you, mutants are too tanky, and there are so many game-breaking bugs and glitches that I legitimately can't get through a single playthrough without encountering one. I know that the community likes to go ""oh haha they're anomalies not bugs"", but when hours of my time gets wasted because of some stupid shit softlocking me, I find it very hard to laugh.

Out of 3 playthroughs, 2 bugged so bad that they weren't salvageable. I've had the utmost patience, more than I would give to most games, and it still is this bad. If any other game was in this state, I wouldn't rate it high, so I must be honest.

I can only hope that the devs actually fix this game. If you do want to get the game, mods are basically required.",negative
"The main story of this game is long. Too long. The game goes on and on....and on. I ended up using a trainer to add infinite stamina and weight capacity. This game is hardcore, and if you can make it to the end without cheats you are a masochist. After beating the game I thought the ending wasn't very good. It didn't give a satisfactory conclusion to why you've been treading through the zone for hours upon hours. There are multiple endings; I looked them all up after completing the game--they're all crap. That being said it's a cool open world RPG game, it's just.... very convoluted and long. I won't be playing through it again.",positive
"This series used to have its own unique identity, being a Stalker used to mean scavenging corpses for ammo and grenades, god willing, some bandages. Now, you walk into an abandoned hut in the middle of nowhere, you'll find a sausage and 2 medkits. It may as well be made by bethesda.

"I have well over a thousand hours in the original, plenty more in the next two games and even more in various mods, like Anomaly.

I've beaten this game as well. I loved the visuals, faithfulness to the setting and real life locations, and a lot of the new elements added.

What I do not like is brain-dead AI, an ""A-Life"" system that is a joke and hardly working at all compared to games that came out almost 20 years ago by the same developers, poor performance, bugs, crashes, the worst English voice-acting I've heard in my life, hours of running for little pay, no end-game, unforgivably bad boss encounters, and a $110 price-tag for the ""full"" experience.

My biggest subjective gripe is the factions. SIRCAA is just Duty but different. Spark is just Freedom but different. Just feels like recreating the past while diminishing those old factions for no real reason.

I know this wasn't a sequel to mods like GAMMA, but man did they not learn anything from those types of mods being so popular. Even disregarding community creations, all three original games are more fun and complete packages compared to STALKER 2.

I'm sure in a year or two this game will be much better, but the bones and base systems are so broken and lackluster that I wouldn't recommend this to even avid STALKER fans. Just go play GAMMA and wait on some patches and mods for this one.",negative
"A fantastic narrative, exploration is vast, the GFX and Sound is outstanding and the gameplay (combat) is top notch and challenging. Stalker 2 has its fair share of bugs and small issues, but nothing game breaking. 4.9 out of 5 only because it wasn't fully polished.",positive
"Love the game but a few things, fan of the stalker franchise but I have been soft locked twice due to main story missions not running because key characters would not appear and there still ram spike issues which just freeze and crashes the game in FUCKING Rostok which is a major town/hub which you will be using a decent bit. IDK what the game devs are doing but after the latest update this is actually worst now for that particular glitch, I have had to use consol commands twice to get past the soft lock, you basically have to spawn in the charecters that the game needs for the custscean to play, the reason why you should get this game is it is a blend of what skyrim was as well as fallout but as A tier slavic gun slop, is it a perfect recreation of the old OG stalker games, fuck no, but its a foundation for something more something better, there is a really lively modding scean and you should get it just for that, because the stuff you will be able to do in game once the devs get their collective shit together and finish fixing these bugs and put in a half way decent AI-life system or someone in the modding community will likely get to it first.

Overall solid game just be aware that there are bugs and there is shit about it that will piss you off at times but overall fun to play.",positive
"So this game was incredible. I know there were some bugs that caused some issues, but I was able to find a workaround for pretty much all of them. I have been playing PC games for decades at this point, so I tend not to get worked up over bugs when I encounter them because I understand why they happen. I got the ending for the Ward. I will play it again and explore the other factions' storyline next. My first play-through was 131 hours. I would say It was worth it. I will also go back and play the other stalker games to completion as well. The newest patch helped out a lot with issues that I ran into. Everyone knows that UE5 is a difficult system to work with, so don't be discouraged by the rumors. The game is good. The game is worth it. The dev team has fixed a lot of crap and will continue to do so. Also, with the most recent patch, it's likely that you won't have any problems at all, so don't sleep on this game!",positive

"I want to like this game, but I haven't been drawn to it after the first couple of weeks. Initially I was wowed, but then the issues. 1. poorly optimised (runs poorly on rtx 4080). 2. no h/w based ray-tracing 3. main story not that engaging, but just good enough 4. AI just spawns in, doesn't feel like its an open world game. Don't get me wrong. the gun fights are great, and it definitely looks pretty for the most part. it has a lot of wow moments, but it's all the stuff in between that's mediocre. I am waiting for h/w RT and AI improvements before I pick it up again",negative
Terrible game just awful I wish I could refund this trash,negative

Played 180+ hours. Had to restart it twice due to massive breaking bugs. Regularly crashes the entire OS with a VRAM leak. I would not recommend.,negative
"As of today (06.02.2025) I cannot recommend the game, because of it's horrendous technical state. I have played the game on all patches from 1.0 to 1.1.4 and had to install band aid mods that made the game more pleasant. My biggest complaint is that I am unable to finish the game, because of crash to desktop exactly in the same place, at the end of the game after the point of no return. I've tried every solution I have found on the internet. I've played the game without mods and on fresh install, same old story always. 

Adding to that, the game is riddled with bugs, balance is all over the place, enemies AI is terrible, A-Life is very simplistic compared to previous games. On positive note, the game has amazing animations and level design, the graphics are beautiful, world is rich with interesting places to visit. 

Main plot, for me at least, is convoluted and hard to follow, there's way too ""relevant"" NPCs and factions, their agendas change in a blink of an eye, each main quest brought me more questions than answers. Because of that the game loses it's momentum and is much less impactful. Sometimes I feel that the main plot was shuffling it's feet in the same place for stretched periods. 

My background: avid fan of the series since first installment, finished each game in vanilla state and with multiple mods dozen of times.",negative
"It is a proper Stalker 2, with all the atmosphere and beautiful jankiness of the original. This is enough for me to give it a thumbs up.

For everybody who is not a fan of the series, there's a long list of reasons to wait for at least half a year until at least some of the points are fixed:
1. Shader compilation at every start of the game. Enjoy a minute or two of stress-testing your CPU for no reason.
2. Lots of crashes. Especially around Rostok and in UI overall.
3. Quite a weird AI of ""human"" enemies. They can see you from 500m ignoring grass and bushes and can hit you with a full clip of AK from there. Multiply in by x5-7 for a random roaming gang. But if you're close they're mostly harmless.
4. A shitton of running around. I, the person who dislikes fast travel, got tired of it. I hope they would change it so guides could lead you to any previously explored location and not only between bars in ""cities"".
5. Extremely weird story tempo (and overall it is convoluted and bloated with meaningless characters). You may spend 20 hrs of gameplay doing small quests for seemingly faceless NPCs with small inclusions of story bits. And then suddenly you run into the Kojima area with talking and movies for 3 hours where everybody references previous faceless NPCs who you already forgot about. This probably will never get fixed.
6. Cinematics by raving fans of Ilya Naishuller movies with extreme action, dramatic jumps, and explosions. They're quite decent separately from the game, but in it, they feel quite out of place, much closer to some Call of Duty vibe than to game where 90% of gameplay is dragging an overloaded backpack with ""habar"" across a swamp and inventory management. Probably will never get fixed too.",positive
"It's a shame, this one

This game runs awfully thanks to it's overuse of expensive Lumen features like GI and Shadows and while all this makes the game look really good (sometimes), it's essentially undone by it's dependency on TAA and TSR, which are a smeary, blurry mess made worse when coupled with lower resolution scaling to try and squeeze as much performance out of the dead horse that is Unreal Engine 5.

I have an RX 6700 non XT coupled with a R5 5600X and 32GB of DDR4 3600, not a super good system, but was only recently made a slouch by terrible unoptimized games and Stalker 2 is unfortunately a prime example. Bend's Days Gone port, an Unreal 4 game, will run at Ultra 140% internal resolution just fine, Cyberpunk runs at Ultra with FSR at Quality just fine and that's a much more complex and dynamic world. I don't know what kind of eyes developers have nowadays but I simply don't see how you can witness the raw, terrible performance this puts out and delude yourself into believing this is just how it is now, not to mention all the BUGS!

GSC games have their fair share of bugs on release, but the piss-poor performance and memory leaks/memory access violation errors combined made this game tough to want to continue, but I persevered in blind faith that it would stabilize over time. To this day on the 5th of Feb this game still has memory access violation crashes, sometimes quests will fail to continue and will be essentially softlocked until a save reload, texture bugs, LOD pop-in. A-Life is wonky, the spawn distance for the director is unusually small, but I wonder if that was done to save on performance more than it was for some other reason.

TL;DR: Game runs terrible without any software bullshit like Frame Gen and Upscaling, unless you have a 7800/7900 or 4070 Ti+. Buggy as fuck too.",negative
needs at least 6-12 more months of patching,negative

"Extreme VRAM limitations on 3070 w/ 8GB. Unplayable 5fps in the loading screen if you are doing anything else on your GPU besides playing the game. This is with the lowest preset possible. Forget screen sharing on discord, even at 720 30.

White boxes appearing and disappearing on cut scenes and now duriong gameplay at the very beginning of the game. Textures constantly not loading in. Just trash

"No disappointment with this game. I've played other two from this series Shadow of Chernobyl and Call of Pripiat and Heart of Chornobyl has the same vibe. I like the weapons and the way you can upgrade them, you have to find best suits to stay alive. A very good game, with nice story and plenty of shooting, looting and roaming.",positive

"Stop pretending this game is awesome. 

It has been broken since day 1. Most anticipated and marketed mechanism isn't even in the game (A life). This mechanism is the only think that makes Stalker franchise something better than other POS eastern games.

Storyline was not even tested thoroughly although this POS hit ""Gold"" before being released. 

Dialogs are stupid.

Game may be worth something in a year, not before.

"game is pretty, good old stalker. 
weight management is utter shit. 
and all NPC's have 100% aimbot. even turds with buckshot nail you from 50 meters and more... and well.. your guns suck... and i played pvp in destiny 2 and most others. 
the whole thing is just unproportionally against you. 

play if you hate urself.",negative
"Game is not in a solid state. Performance is kinda ok, but could be better. Mechanic wise, the game is totally unfair in its design and it frustrates me to a point I let the game alone for a few weeks then tryed again but with no different results. 

The whole monster spawn system is broken, A-Life is still broken even after patch 1.1.3, the world feels shallow and then offcourse comes the frustration with all kinds of things like ammo, weight system, health system. And yes you can install mods but this fixes the game in a to little extend. 

I recommend NOT buying this game.",negative
"BLUF: Venturing into the zone with an open mind and desire to fight will produce the best fun-driven results in this latest S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game. 

As a long-time fan of the franchise and an ardent supporter of the ""living economy"" of NPC actions/reactions and ""choices that matter"", S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 brings forth a fresh look onto the scene all while staying true to its roots and not selling itself out to trends. Gun fights, story-line, enemies, side quests, artifact hunting, and factions are all enjoyable and welcome aspects of the experience. Although it was significantly more enjoyable in some regards to enemy encounters after the first major update bringing balancing changes to certain enemies.

The drawbacks?
After the major updates that have come out, I am still having issue getting stuck with shader caching not letting me out of the opening screen and the program dominating my applications to the point where I had to switch to playing in borderlines window, so that I could reliably swap applications to close the game when it would inevitably freeze and require a restart.

There are times where it feels as though the living world is not living quite as well as it should and perhaps could use some tweaks to help with the background activities of NPCs as the game seeks to have a unique and compelling environmental experience. 

Closing:
I am sure in due time that the studio will find ways to alleviate these issue but in my opinion, and the recent steam reviews of now may be an indicator of a broader agreement, there are still issues left to be worked out that while they do not break the game (in my experience at least) they do break immersion and cause the game as a whole to fall short of its intended goal.

I wish the studio luck and to anyone who reads this, I encourage you to give the game a go and take it slow so you don't miss any potential gifts the Zone would offer. They can be quite scarce at times but quite helpful as well.",positive
feels dead compared to the older games,negative
"I strongly recommend not to buy. 

Developers are scammers. Not only they are simply living from the shadow of previous STALKER games (which weren´t that good, either), but are lying about the content of the game. Not to mention they are not able to fix it at all. 

They simply picked the worst possible engine which isn´t capable to process everything. 

Broken quests, broken shaders, ""Haha, bugs are anomalies"" - yeah, laugh into our faces, very funny! AI is broken beyond belief and won´t be fixed anytime soon - or at all. At least older games form the series were good at this. 

Don´t bother with this empty husk of former glory. I hope this will be the last game you ever do, devs.",negative
Constant crash generator.,negative
"STALKER 2 is a beautiful mess, Vanilla has some of the worst mechanics but community made mods create a truly challenging yet rewarding experience. 

Tweaks made to enemy health, weapon ballistics and gear progression create for realistic and enjoyable firefights, with options for stealth or guns blazing. 

Tweaks made to the economy and to gear degradation create a more balanced and enjoyable looting and trading experience. 

Tweaks made to A-Life and NPC behaviour create a lively world filled with with roaming factions battling eachother and mutants, or loners exploring anomalies. 

I died 205 times on my first playthrough, and will probably play ANOMALY while waiting for Stalker 2s own version.

"I absolutely love this game. I'm aware of the issues faced by some but I've not had anything game breaking so far. I've  basically stuck to the lesser zone while i wait for patches but what i can say is that, for me, it's run perfectly and looks amazing. I'm happy just exploring the map, drinking in the atmosphere of constant creeping dread, feeling the tingle of fear if night starts to fall and i'm too far from the safe zone for comfort. 
Does it need a few more patches? Yes, for sure, but like CP2077 (which i also bought on release) i'm having a blast with this and it's only going to get better as time goes on.",positive
"What are you guys smoking to create such a piece of crap? Who is interested in fighting air bubbles, flying electric bubbles and all sorts of other things? Yes, there may be some, but not so much that you are constantly getting hurt instead of fighting enemies or some kind of creature. You will be very disappointed with the game.",negative
"9h: The game is good so far, haven't encountered any bugs. The story and the atmosphere is very immersive despite some gameplay details that could have been adjusted.",positive
"I am a huge fan of the original trilogy. Long story short - it's not the game I was anticipating all these years, but it's still STALKER, and nice game as well (a lot of problems though, but not critical at all).

At the time when I'm writing this review, I think the game is pretty much stable to play it on good PC.

So, personally I would recommend playing STALKER 2, either you are a fan or not, doesn't matter, the game is interesting and I wouldn't play it for 135 hours if it was bad or just because I'm a fan. (I know it's a lot, you can spend around 60-90 hours still having explored most of the places and completed side quests)
----------------------------
BUT I STRONGLY recommend to play original trilogy first, if you have time. Those are cool games and you those will reveal a lot of lore and storyline of the characters. 
But it's not obligation, The Second Part mostly try to explain a lot of past lore and story to you.",positive

"You know, I really want to love this game. The mechanics seem so great, and the world seems to be really rich. I even enjoyed a great deal of my time playing so far, but the game is just in such a bad state performance wise. I went from looking forward to playing at the end of the day to having to force myself to play because I wanted to continue in the story. It got to the point where I was just too annoyed with the performance, and a couple times the fuzzy graphics and high latency (due to the fact that it is unplayable without upscaling) actually made my eyes hurt and made it hard to actually know what I was looking at. A couple times I died to some stupid enemy because the latency was so bad that I was over correcting my aim and missing my shots. 

I really hope that the game continues to improve. The developer seem to be committed to updating the game, so we will just have to see how things go.",negative
"Great game, poor optimization. The game play is very good but its not optimized to rum that well, if you can get past the performance issues then i highly recommend this game. If subpar performance is a deal breaker to you, then i recommend waiting for the devs to fix the optimization. overall its a very good game.

After playing this game for awhile longer, the optimization is unacceptable. At first it wast anything deal breaking, just some frame drops in certain areas, minor bugs and so on. However the longer i played the worse it got. i experienced several game crashes and then it would work perfectly fine only to happen again shortly there after. Tons of bugs and frame drops making the game not enjoyable and  annoying to play. Today (02-13-25) they released a ""major update"" ""fixing"" the performance and bugs. I launched the game excited to see if any of the problems were fixed only to not be able to make it past the loading screen before the game crashes. 
 Unfortunately I cannot recommend this game in its current state",negative

Other than that, you'll be dealing with a lot of memory leaks and other bugs as of right now. At least every few hours you'll have to restart. That, or the game will just stop responding either from alt+tab or for no good reason at all.
Fall damage is stupid in this game. Crapton of underwhelming stashes after which you just can't not say ""is that it??"" out loud.

WHY IS THE FLASHLIGHT NOT UPGRADABLE??? 
You can deck out your armor and exoskeleton with super durable materials, slap on lead containers that prevent radiation from leaking, you can visit labs that have all the tech of the world, but you can't shove a fucking LED BULB INTO YOUR LAMP? WTF?
I can live with Skif not being able to swim, but falling 3 meters on his feet and dying? Come on...

I kind of regret pre-ordering, to be honest.
Just wait another 6 months for the devs to finish optimizing game.
Not as bad and Cyberpunk when it just came out, but definitely cutting it close.",negative
"Stalker 2 is tough, brutal, unforgiving & I absolutely love it!",positive
"There is a lot to love here for me. Look, I remember waiting for the first one to launch. It feels like both games went through the same cycle for me: Seeing people both praise and hate on the game, who knows how I will like it, right? Then I play it and it's beautiful, mysterious, weird, and yes it has it's own special flavor of 'jankiness', to glitches that at times I was irritated with. But nothing has ever come close to making me second guess my decision to buy this game.

If you like any of the stalkers, you will like this game. This is not one of those lame sequels from a AAA that they nerf under giant committees of people with no vision. I think a lot of people that rate and vote on games make the perfect the enemy of the good. This game FEELS like a stalker game and they've all had their weird set ups on certain things and by now you should know that this is a fundamental part of the personality of a team of people that obviously loved making this and put their hearts into it. 

There are subtle points of brilliance in this game that I can see and appreciate. Maybe it's in my head, but I doubt it. This game is good and you should buy it if you have ever enjoyed a FPS with great setting and don't mind a little weirdness when it comes to how everything fits together.

There was going to be a whole paragraph ranting about how disappointed I am in with all those big AAA franchises. Screw it, you already know don't you?",positive
Great game,positive

chill vibes,positive
"I started off loving this game, and that love quickly turned to hatred and a need to finish it as quickly as possible.  
Game/Level Design/World Design 
Good - I will say firstly that the atmosphere with the “Zone” is really captured well.  I actually watched some documentary footage and compared it with the game and it seems to capture the essence of what the area is all about.  
Bad - with the atmosphere out of the way.  The Engine, Unreal Engine 5, which is atrocious by the way, does a bad job at making things enjoyable or capturing the vision I believe the devs laid out. Can’t explain, Cut down review to fit this text box.
Gameplay 
Good - can say I enjoyed myself at times.  There were some pretty cool combat scenarios where I felt like I was really immersed and felt like a real Stalker once my gear was leveled and I had modified my guns to my liking.  I really enjoy games that are survivalist/looter shooter, post apocalyptic types.  So, I gravitated to the go here, kill this person, loot, search for artifacts, repair gear, mod weapons type of stuff.  If you wanted to scratch that itch it will do that for you. 
Bad - The AI is atrocious. I have been shot at personally un-aimable distance by guys carrying nothing more than saw off shotguns, I could barely snipe them with full on 4x scoped 7.62 rifles from the same distance they were aim botting me from “across the map” distances.  
Which leads me to my next gripe about gameplay.  Mutant enemies, aside from the low level ones, are bullet sponges. Feels old. I thought Stalker had factions. They play little to no effect on the world.  
Graphics 
Good- in still shots, like looking at faces and seeing the interactions of characters.  They do convey a lot of emotion.  Also, the character voicing was pretty good in my opinion which made the graphics more convincing.
Bad  -  UE5 is trash.  I said it.  It is an unoptimized pile of garbage.  I feel like I see better polished graphics in games like CP 2077 and Far Cry or Source engine products.
Story/Lore 
Good - I felt like the game did a good job of getting me sucked in early.
Bad - as the game develops you start to develop questions. I spent a lot of time reading the recordings, notes and PDAs/tablets I would find along the way and that did answer some questions and also provided some insight into what would happen next.  However, after the halfway point. Terrible. The second half with all the rushed aspects, poorly executed story line, and the game breaking issues. It became average.  And quite frankly I loathed my experience so much that I was rushing to get out of it and just make it stop.
Bugs/Glitches 
Good - there is at least 2 money glitches, which can allow you to stack up for your costly equipment, upgrades, repairs and items about half way through the story, which by no coincidence is exactly where all the bugs start. Notice how the “good glitches” are there to fix the stupid economy. Which is broken.  Simple math, get paid 40 k coupons for a multihour quest only to get a 80 k coupons repair!
BAD - Folks, there is no way to describe this game other than saying “I have played better early access games.”I have a list of things that happened.
Speaking to NPC causes them to come out of their chair, as if they are levitating like a far east guru or a god of some sort.  Quite hilarious.
Up until patch 1.1.4 I had shader compiling issues, where the entire system would freeze or lock up,  on my AMD system which caused me to have to download nexus mods to fix it.  This was recently patched, and wasn’t an issue on the Nvidia system, however this took 3 months.  Unacceptable!
Quests that are out of sync, can’t be completed due to bugs where you previously explored earlier, you may run across a quest task and get an item only to give that item to someone else and not be able to complete another quest later.
Not to mention enemies or allies not spawning in during main line quests or disappearing from view like the cut scene or set of steps wasn’t properly ironed out.
Having to reload saves because of this issue and try a different set of steps for all these glitches listed here, losing hours of gameplay/items received and stored.
Random freezes and crashes aside from all these other glitches, not associated with inventory or quests/cutscenes.
Enemies popping in behind, side, front of you out of nowhere.  You turn clear off a 3 walled area, go to exit and get shot in the back by 2-3 guys who obviously spawned on top of you.
Inventory glitches - where the inventory starts overlapping itself.  Like where guns and armor overlap, ammo, attachments, consumables and artifacts, to where you can’t see what is in your box or you think they “disappeared” which you then have to try and play “whack a mole” to pull random things out to see what is revealed behind said thing in the hopes you find the ammo or consumable you been saving
While accessing the box, random crashes, where you access your inventory box go to slide something from your person to the storage, or vice versa, and the whole system craps out
Or, while accessing inventory there is a memory leak, where memory fills all 32 gbs of DDR 5, I even upgrades to 64 gbs of DDR 5 and it still happens.  They patched this recently in the 1.1.4 in Rostock only, but I have experienced this since the patch in nearly every town/base location.  
Anomalies like the gravitational one, where you following the designated most common sense path, then you jump and it teleports you to no man's land, with a negative compass value  2 billion something, reload/Ctrl - ALT - Delete out of it.
I would find random floating ammo boxes, as if they were attached under a machine gun, just floating out in space and consumables. 
Guides disappearing, one example is the one in Yanviv station that you teleported to and now he is gone.  Just gone, and there is no reason to go there now, because you would have to run to the next closest city which wastes time and defeats the purpose of fast travel to begin with.
Because of this, several times in game, I had to download the UE Console commands to fix and move forward in several main line story quests just to progress. One I had to initiate an emission to make a guy talk to me. The emission system in game broke and I couldn’t get anymore artifacts because they weren’t respawning and the guys never moved, not allowing me to initiate dialogue. This happened several times where I had to manually tell the engine to start, complete and start the next quest. Terrible.
In one instance just this past week, I ran into a group of enemies where basically the character model skeletons were present, like literally their armor was gone, no helmet, fleshy human face all the way down to neck, and the rest of the body looked like Terminator T100.  It was metal, holding a gun, and they moved forward with no character animations shooting me. I laughed so hard for this sick joke that is being played on customers of this product.
I lost many hours of progress reloading saves, backtracking, having to reclaim and regather supplies so many times by the end of it I was done, I barely made it to the end after restarting and reloading so many times, I am afraid to even try anymore. I completed the game story, reloaded a save before “The point of no return” and tried to just go explore the zone and I opened my inventory storage box and the whole game crashed again which sums it up. Crash and burn.
Verdict
At the beginning I would have given this a 9 or 10. But now a 5-6/10 is generous and a 4/10 is what I feel like. If they fix everything, 7/10 is probably what I would give it.
I CANNOT, recommend the game in its current state, IF and not, When the bugs are ALL fixed and the game is playable,  I would say it is worth a playthrough if you want that survival/horror, post apocalypse feel in an FPS/looter shooter format. But will leave you wanting more still.

Game breaking bugs in the main story.

"TLDR: Gameplay and story is alright but the game engine is really really hurting this game.

Unreal Engine 5 and it's consequences have been a disaster to the gaming industry. Sure the SCREENSHOTS of this game look amazing but when you get into gameplay, even if you have 40 series gpu and other top of the line specs, the game chugs like all hell. It really boils down to the choice of playing with DLSS off and having the game turn into a Powerpoint presentation or playing with DLSS on and everything looks like The Matrix slowmo shots with phantom images trailing being you and the world around you as you move.

I can't say much as someone who has never played any of the previous STALKER games, but I do think the story and gameplay are alright. Guns hit hard both in your hands and in the hands of the enemy and anytime you come across a reference to a previous game there is always a ""give me the lore"" dialogue option which still fits in the game since Skiff, the character you play as is a newcomer to The Zone himself. It's a fairly captivating story that will keep you playing for a while (if you can bear the performance issues). Sadly the good impressions I have of the game of overshadowed by the absolutely God awful optimization and there honestly isn't anything that can be done about it. The optimization issues, the memory leak issues, they're all systemic to UE5 and these issues are plain as day to anyone who has a game developer's eye which makes it all the more perplexing that so many studios are ditching their in house engines to make their games in UE.",negative
"I tried to be forgiving to the many many flaws this game has knowing the backstory of the development. Could not get myself to finish it way to many frustrating design and narrative decisions. Not that they care they got my money I guess. Sub par I was expecting more. The world is cool, everything else is meh",negative
" Completed the game on medium difficulty and now have a full picture.

 What I liked about this game:
- Characters. Pretty much all of them. Each one has a unique look, feel, and personality, making them feel real. Even minor NPCs have their own quirks that make them interesting.
- Graphics & Visuals. The game looks fantastic, especially the environments. The artists did an amazing job capturing the Zone after all these years. Exploring old, familiar locations in a fresh way is incredibly satisfying. Anomalies and artifacts? A solid 10/10. Everything visual in this game is on point.
- Side Quests. Many of them were far more engaging and enjoyable than the main story. I just wish there were more of them.
- Gunplay. Weapons feel great to use in combat. They are different. Sure, the AI has its issues, but the core gunplay itself is solid.

 Things I didn’t like or found annoying:
- Main Story. It’s too long yet somehow feels both stretched and rushed at the same time. Some sections barely make sense, as if they were added just to fill space. Missions tend to boil down to ""run and shoot a bunch of enemies,"" with conveniently placed ammo and medkits along the way to keep you going. The side quests have far more variety. The whole thing feels more like a Hollywood blockbuster than a proper STALKER experience. You are in an abandoned underground tunnel? Be sure to meet whole squad of armed man inside or at the end of mission.
- Medical System. After a while, you can just stand there and tank damage by spamming medkits with zero penalties. No restrictions, no consequences. By the end, Skif should’ve been an addict.
- Stats. Just what the quack is that? Low, Mid, Strong? Where are sum of my gear, where is statistics tab in PDA, where is reputation tab? \_0_/
- Rewards. Whether it’s quest rewards, stash loot, or enemy drops, none of it really matters. Everything feels generic and uninspired. You only need money for repairs, and upgrading weapons/armor is only worthwhile in the second half of the game by which point, you’ll have more than enough cash anyway.
- Too Much Running. At first, it's fine, exploring and doing side quests is fun. But once you realize you can spam energy drinks and the main story keeps making you sprint across the entire map, it becomes a chore. Points of interest dry up quickly, leaving you with little more than artifact farming. Random NPC encounters? Practically nonexistent.
- Mutants. They look cool, but they’re more of an annoyance than a real threat. There’s little incentive to engage with them since they don't provide rewards.
- Technical Issues. Characters randomly contorting their limbs, standing motionless in doorways, or getting stuck in animation loops these things break immersion, especially when it happens to major characters.

 Final Thoughts:
Do I regret buying and finishing the game? No, I don’t.
Will I replay it for different endings? Unlikely.
Will I replay it once the modding community gets their hands on it? Absolutely.

As it stands, the game is mid - nothing more, nothing less. If you're a STALKER fan, it's worth playing.

"First off, let me say this. I LOVE the stalker series, and Stalker 2 is no exception. However, in the close (at the time of this writing) to 300 hours I have in the game, there are very clear flaws. Adaptive difficulty is a huge one. Yes, I know you can set difficulty in the settings, but the way it ramps up, to where I'm getting dropped by SMG's by Exo wearing AI that don't miss a shot and do more damage than I ever will with the same guns, let alone they fire straight through cover and concealment, huge problem.
This staked with the issues of Alife 2.0, and having AI spawn right in front of me and smoke me with in a blink of the eye, I cannot recommend it as it stands. 

I will happily recommend and write a new review once the issues are fixed,",negative

"I love Stalker. I loved it ever since I played SoC on my first PC that could barely run it, sharing progress updates with a buddy of mine, having an older colleague at work translate NPC barks to me (- 'hey, what does ""oruzhe obral"" mean?' - 'put the gun away'). It should therefore be obvious that I'm far from impartial.

I've been looking for something that'd capture the magic of originals. 
There have been plenty of games that promised the same eerie atmosphere, the sense of mystery and unease as the original Stalker trilogy. Some I thought even came quite close.

Trust me when I say this, nothing can quite hold a candle to Stalker 2 in these aspects. I thought the Zone could hold no more mysteries, and I was wrong. 

Why am I writing this after - checks notes - 167 hours of play time, having completed one and a half of a playthrough? Truth is, I wasn't quite comfortable recommending this to non-fans at release (I figured people like me would have already bought it), and people who are still on the fence would bounce off the 1.0 release due to some issues it still had.

That's all behind us now, though - I haven't encountered anything that'd negatively affect my enjoyment of the game since the  current 1.1.4 patch. There's still some jank, mind you, but it'll keep getting better.

I regret that my command of the language isn't enough to give this game justice - it's at the same time beautiful, challenging, whimsical, melancholy, and tragic. There are times I just stare at the screen, taking in the scenery, or the music. It is, not to put too fine a point on it, art.",positive

"Feels like Stalker, there's jank as you know it, but better.

Only bad parts are:

- Optimization so far sucks
- Eye Adaptation/Auto Exposure is absolutely horrendous (that effect where your screen gets dark when you look at lights - you can't disable that)
- Hardcoded keybinds (that are terribly implemented on the dumbest of buttons)
- Crouch vignette (your screen darkens when you crouch... why?)

Luckily, mods can fix some of these (altho, eye adaptation and hardcoded keys are still unfixable with mods as of now).",positive

"Stalker series is my favorite games but Stalker 2 is not one of them...
And problem is not even in bugs, optimization or AI, they will be fixed sooner or later(i believe).

First is gameplay, compared to previous games it feels casual: ton of loot per square meter, human enemies almost dont do damage, interesting mechanics when you have low HP enemies stop attacking you for a moment, instant HP recovery from a medkit, lethal anomalies dont kill you and all this on veteran difficulty.

Some things break immersion: yellow marked ladders and boards(is it really that hard to spot them without that?), headshot hit sound, freshly painted green ammo crates, huge amount of nіgers(there are more nіgers in zone than in all Ukraine) who speak pure ukrainian, 90% of radio music is just bad, also headlamp has no shadows or it located on camera transform, which makes it feel weird.

Voice acting, cutscenes and animations. I played game in ukrainian voice acting and it is bad, i dont know how to explain it but in real life people dont talk like that, and together with cringe cutscenes i felt like i was watching stupid action movie, also developers forgot to make a lip sync for ukrainian voice acting. Especially annoying FOV decreasing during dialogues and stupid hand gestures(instead of getting gun, you say cringe phrase and warm up your hands when choosing a combat option). Weapon animations are generally not bad, but animation interrupting is just hell. When you using medkit and start running at wrong time, it just doesnt using, same with reloading. Is it was hard make possible to run while reloading and healing?

I still couldnt get into plot because of bad cutscenes and voice acting, but i also didnt understand main character motivation, if he needed money, why did he chase scanner that probably already been sold 50 times instead of farming artifacts and quests.

I will add that all enemies with dead guns, but at same time they can drop full armor, also balance of artifacts was too simplified to those that giving radiation and others that giving protection from it.

As result, i think will replay game later after patches, but even after them game will not be at the level of previous games.",negative

The mo-cap, voice acting and story are what stand out the most in STALKER 2, it just wants to tell you its story, which you won't get unless you've spent hours on youtube reading lore dumps, I did, so it was satisfying, for the most part, to see one of the 4 endings the game gives you.

The bugs haven't been bad for me, but I'm starting to see it get kinkier with a long play through. Exploration is great. Puzzles to find loot and codes to loot is a really neat surprise. Monsters are funner to fight than ever. Guns and shooting are great. There's a lot of things it does better than the original. Story and characters are really, very surprisingly good. Anyhow, I could keep going singing it praises, but for the bad: #1 lack of proper A-Life. It's still STALKER, but diet STALKER. The graphics are pretty great, but I could see them getting better with some time; they seem unfinished in some ways, like some lighting effects. Gun's degrade too fast (economy is good, though, despite what everyone is complaining about). Long foot treks are good despite what everyone is complaining about. Mutants are tough, but not too tanky like everyone is complaining about. Aim bots is a little bit of a problem [update, this has been fixed in 1.2] . Day-night cycle is too fast (can't understand why they did this). There are too many weather storms. I wish we had more and longer nice days in the Zone and sunrises and sunsets weren't so fast. Let them patch it up, and of those things I mentioned, if they don't fix it, look for some mods. They're destined to come. My positive review still stands. It is a great game even now.

"60FPS BELOW-MINIMUM SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS! Don’t worry if your computer isn’t said to be powerful enough to run STALKER2, it may even still get 60fps YES! With an i7-6800k, slower cores and smaller caches than a 7700k, I had minimum 44, average 54 and maximum 61 frame rate at the start of the game where you look back at the spawning swamp and pillar of light at the bottom of the ramp where there is an electrical spark, running and spinning around 180, 270, and 360 degrees in the flick of a mouse because that’s what most FPS gamers do: helicopters, like we also do them in Elden Ring and Forza and COD. Because the gameplay of players aren’t equally demanding, and for those who don’t do helicopters or aim too quickly, it is easy to explain that a very quick moving scene spinning 180 degrees in about 0.2seconds, and then bouncing back in another 0.2, on repeat, requires a tremendous amount more system resources than a still-scene where you just stand there and look. Having quad-channel over dual-channel, and 32gigs not 16 of RAM helps, even more so an RTX3050 that’s equally as powerful as a 2070SUPER, although when this first came out I could barely struggle to load with massive loading times for texture compiling each time I started not only as I had 16gigs of RAM back then but also the game was taking up all 16gigs of it! Now it needs a few less than 16. An SSD is required. Those of you running an ATI I am sure similar settings are available for graphics, but the trick is to under-resolution the game, it is said to run at 30FPS for 1080P which is 1920x1080 2million+ pixels, I hit the crisp 54average by doing 1440x900 1.3million pixels, so rendering an amount less than two-thirds of pixels at 1440 versus 1920 helps to reduce hardware cost by the same amount! And on my 15 year-old display Samsung P2250 with 1920x1080 21.5inches it still looks just fine! I am sure the game still forces the Anti-Aliasing and Anisotropic Filtering settings-on, but having them both to off on the nvidia control panel for the game markedly increases the responsiveness. FSR3.1 OFF: we want to use the lowered settings (mostly resolution really) to hit that 60fps-display’s responsiveness, and REFLEX won’t help with responsiveness if you are running at 15~20frames and can’t see anything properly, along with how much lower it drops. Thus I think for an angry and challenging FPS game STALKER2 is it should really help players hit 40 or 50fps at least! Everything to low or off and near draw-distance, I found having the nvidia control panel settings with application-controlled rather than off for A-A and anisotropic filtering lowers performance, with fraps99 still works recording frame-time and rate benchmarks but just couldn’t display over the game, but performance will be improved if you turn on the trilinear and sample optimisation options for texture filtering as they will help the game reduce the amount of resources required to do the game-forced filterings. Gamma correction helps with the game not looking so patchy at a lower resolution although I must say base-settings 1440Elden Ring vs base-settings 1440STALKER2 on my 21inch 1080P monitor still looks a looot worse! Anti-Aliasing Transparency OFF!  Performance and power options of highest and maximum of course. Low-Latency mode shouldn’t be ultra for this game you cannot aim and react at 60fps/60hz or 60times a second! On if your CPU is really low-powered so the CPU can only do 1/60frames per second, Off for most users with a good enough graphics card which won’t mean that CPU is rendring a lot or quite a few frames, I have the framerate set at 60 so to dictate how the Computer is rendering to not over-render when more idle, in big settings over-rendering really slows the reaction time when jerky actions are enacted. Vulkan swapchain to: Native. LOD bias to: Allow, improves performance once again, when looking around the 2 texture filterings will ease to reduce performance overhead. GDI compatibility to: Prefer Performance. CUDA sysmem fallback to: driver default for most cases, no fallback if you are short on system RAM and have a big enough graphics card, prefer sysmem if your graphics card is small. Up-scaling options are all useless, just under-resolution and apply AA & AF.",positive

"Immersive game with beautiful photo-realistic environments, great gunplay, great voice acting (Ukrainian audio, haven't listened to the English yet), and an incredibly detail rich world which brings Chernobyl and the exclusion zone to life. Issues so far (and possibly deal breaking ones depending on your patience and tech skills) are the bugs and crashes, which are being fixed slowly... but in my opinion, are worth working around to play such a fantastic game. 
Слава Україні!",positive
"Still very poorly optimized. The unreal 5 engine does not perform well and despite having the recommended hardware and then some, it struggles to run on my machine at modern resolutions (2K or 4K). Maybe that's snobbish, but it's not unreasonable to expect properly optimized performance out of the gate. The game requires extensive tuning to get it to run at a stable 60 fps unless you're running bleeding edge hardware (and specifically Nvidia at that). Load times upon launching the game are excessive, and the shader engine continues to present problems.

Lacking in AI features which were in the original. Overly-difficult when the underdevelopment of the AI, both in their excessive accuracy and their unsophisticated/environmentally non-responsive behavior, combines with the existing performance problems. NPCs are not particularly well-developed in dialogue or interface either. They somehow feel more primitive than the simplistic versions we had in Stalker 1, maybe because the engine and time advancement would suggest we should have more. The interaction doesn't even need to be complex, simply immersive and well done. It's more immersive to have well written background NPCs with interesting side-chatter and a few interesting primary NPCs with detailed dialogue, than it is to have scripted scenes and sequences with characters that we don't truly care about, happening over and over. This is in tandem with the fact AI doesn't interact much with the environment yet, as mentioned. Stalker 1 NPCs took cover aggressively, closed or expanded combat engagement distance, picked up dropped weapons, ate food or used medical supplies to heal, and variously interacted with fallen enemies (such as predatory mutants dragging off human bodies to feed and so on). None of that happens here in Stalker 2. Enemies also generally fight to the death; very little self-preservation seen in the first game occurs here.

Exploration feels unsatisfying and is encumbered by an interface that tries to be immersive, but results in slow, frustrating reactions to player conditions. The interface in Shadow of Chernobyl used to pull up instantaneously . Animations would play for certain actions, but would not stop the flow of gameplay. Here, it takes noticeable time for the player to physically open his backpack, and all actions which would otherwise be instantaneous (such as eating) now take appreciable real time. It becomes frustrating far quicker than it immerses the player, since the difficulty of the game (at least at the beginning) feels so artificially high. I just wanted to get on with other objectives during these momentary pauses. The ""little touches"" ended up adding nothing. 

The atmosphere and story are not particularly engrossing. Lacks the inherent charm of the original. The opening of Stalker 2 somehow has less pull than Stalker 1, despite seemingly more development going into a tutorial and opening plot hook. It felt better to be able to wander around freely and quickly in Stalker 1, as well as intuitive. The only thing holding you back was your willingness to quest, or explore. Stalker 2 has a barriers to this at the start, and I found elements of the tutorial frustrating; early encounters with anomalies in the tutorial went worse than my experiences with them late-game in Stalker 1. I couldn't tell you who the characters are here, despite having vague but lasting impressions from the original game of many of the primary plot characters. I remember the general story beats from Stalker 1, but nothing was engrossing in the opening hours of Stalker 2, so much so that I lost interest in playing it. Similarly the world is over-built, too large for this type of game. Stalker 1 worked on a modestly large, but tightly woven and concentrated experience. Stalker 2 appears to be going for size, without meaningful reason for it. Wandering between isolated towns and outposts is not really fun given the performance difficulties and other issues mentioned above. 

These are just a few things jotted off the top of my head, not particularly structured. My impressions may be too hasty, but there's very little grabbing me about this. It just didn't land as a quality product. 

Overall, I wish I had waited, or not purchased it. Regret buying the season pass for this when I did buy it. Unfortunately I've waited too long to play it to be able to request a refund. 

This game may be good in six months, or a year, but it feels far from finished today. 

I hope GSC Gameworld is able to update it and fix the game!",negative
I have been waiting for a great return of stalker. Now for obvious reasons I'm happy with the game despite the war that is currently going on behind the dev studio who have lost developers during the war. May God rest there souls. But giving my review it's a good game some bugs of course but I would have expected this game to get canceled entirely of it were in America and we were attacked so II'm more then happy to say that it's a good game and a lot of things and different missions to do so I would recommend it to anybody who likes a grittier setting and story of mix soviet and modern day depression that the game captures great.,positive

"STALKER 2 brings back some fond old memories.
The game runs relatively well for me minus some issues here and there, but so far I've had a decent playing experience.
Most notable bugs I've come across is a memory leak / CTD issue with Rostok, permanent psi effect, and FPS dipping to 5, but that last one is very rarely.
Despite what people are saying about bugs, I've had very minimal run-ins other than what I've mentioned above.
Atmosphere is just as I remembered it and keeps me immersed for hours.
Enemies still keep you on edge in many instances of the game.
The story is good, at the very least it's better than most stories out there nowadays.
Gameplay is also fairly good, maybe a little more simplified than the original games, but still good nonetheless.
It's definitely a good play if you're a die hard STALKER fan, but the issues people are experiencing may turn the average gamer away.
Hopefully with time these issues are resolved for a majority of the players, as this game is a great solo experience.
I see myself revisiting STALKER 2 more as issues are resolved.
",positive
"TL;DR: If you enjoyed the prior STALKER games, are a fan of open world games or shooters and, most importanlty, are not afraid of bugs runing the experience (I'm talking not being able to proceed through ther game kind of bugs) then STALKER 2 is a must, it hase some issues, but nothing that you won't be able to get pass, if you are worried about bugs or your rig is not as powerfull, wait this one out, GSC is working to solve the glaring issues and by the EoY we will surely have an optimized and almost bug free experience, also, DLC (Maybe, nothing has been confirmed but the map has a lot of places you can't acces but are mentioned and can be seen on the map, might be hints to future DLC).

When STALKER 2 was first announced, after more than 10 years of no new entries on the IP I was scared, it's no secret that developers have dumbed down their games for a broader audience (Not calling anyone out, VG is billion dollar industry and margins need to be met, so audiences need to be bigger), well, after almost 140 hours on one plauthrough and 2 endings done I'm happy to say that STALKER 2 is still STALKER.

The game is still hard and unforgiving for those that are not adequately prepared to brave the Zone, mutants are still scary and dangerous, gunfights are still a constant (Perhaps too constant) and exploration is still the difference between a death rookie on the Cordon and a veteran that has seen everyhting on the Zone.

Almost all parts of the Zone previously visited in prior games are available and almost all of the map is free to explore once it opens ups letting the player to choose in what order to visit certain parts of the Zone, buiolding their own path through upgrades and sidequests.

Now, is the game perfect? ABSOLUTELY NOT and GSC is well aware of it's many issues, you can browse the negative reviews to find if there is something you'll miss, currently the biggest missing feature is A-LIFE, not to say that there are no random encounters or no AI, it's just not as refined as previous installments.

Finally, the elepahnt i the room, the game is very unstable, CTD's and crashes in general are fairly common, the optimization is terrible, it takes a while to load a save file and don't get me started on the shader compiler (Granted, crashes related to it are mostly fixed at least on my end, but it still takes a good while to load), finally, there's a ton of bugs, bugs that leat to not being able to progress a quest (Both of the main and side variety), NPCs dissapear, gravi anomalies can fling you into oblivion, audio get's glitched, menu's get glitched and many more, still, GSC is aware and working on all of theses issues (Where's the road map GSC?) but if you can wait for fixes I would recommend it so.

Lastly I want to add a couple of grievances from my side:

- Gun balance is all over the place, weapons that should be more accurate on longer ranges are not, weapons that should be stronger struggle to kill heavy armored foes, the RPG can't kill chimeras and pseudogiants in less than 2 rockets, the starting pistol is so good there's no point in using any other pistol (It's also a quest item so it can't leave your inventory, so it weights almost nothing) almost to the end and many more issues you can find.
- I always ended with a lot of healing items in prior games, but this time around it's ridiculous, I ended my playthrough with almost 1K medkits and almost 2K bandages, had to put a limit on how many I can pick up (Which was a generous 40 of each) because if I didn't I would be lugging like 100 of em, otherwise my entire capacity would be spend on medkits and bandages, the same can be said with almost all types of normal ammo as well.
- Artifact balance is also wierd, legendary artifacts are so good you only need one of each most of the time, almost all arch-artifacts are useless with the exception of the Weird Water, which is so broken and easy to obtain that is almost a requirement.
- There's A LOT of bloodsuckers on the game, specially on the starting area, meanwhile fleshes were so rare I probably found less than 20 and I explored everything I could on the Zone.
- The respawn system that they use to replace A-LIFE it's still a mess, it still spawns people in your vecinity, this also includes mutants, near the end be prepared to find a snork swarm (Yes, a swarm, literally more than 5) that just spawned like 10 meters beside you, while in some places the game may decide to spawn infinte monolithians.

In general, none of the issues raised by the community or ny me are core gameplay issues or related to it, the biggest hinderance this game has is the bugs and poor optimization and stability, the other ones are minor tweeks at worst, I recommend this game to any fan of the series, of shooters and open world games, STALKER as a series has always been a uniquer beast, and STALKER 2 is no exception.",positive
"I enjoy this game and it's aspects despite bugs that the developers are working hard on fixing. I enjoy how your exploration is rewarded with stashes, hidden special weapons, and artifacts.  however, (sorry developers, i'm writing as I play my second play-through) oh my god screw the boss fights. specifically Faust. there is so much happening and so many bodies despite me focusing on Faust specifically that it is a miracle i finished the game the first time. I don't have the highest NASA performance computer but it runs doom eternal smoothly. Faust makes me so irritated, so angry, so jaded that in my first play-through, I restarted my game to find exo armor, i hauled an RPG7 with 5 RPG7 rounds, the Glutton with 700 total rounds, and the specked out spas12. I only beat Faust the first time because of the amount of crap I brought and i still spent 30 minuets fighting him because he is trying to crash my PC so hard. also, (which this is being addressed by the developers, yay) can't finish my ward play-through due to the Duga tunnels being up for random chance on whether or not the doors will unlock to allow me to progress. All in all, i very much enjoy this game, I just really hate the boss fights ( yes, this includes Strelok and Scar, but they are no where near as bad and are generally manageable; and have reasonable quirks that are not nearly as ridiculous as Faust). I highly recommend this game, just be sure your pc can actually handle it. ( i'm sorry, I really like this game and I want to see it succeed)",positive

"Do I recommend STALKER 2?

No not at all. I'll admit I did like it at first and was willing to overlook some problem's with the game and there are indeed problem's with it. so I got to the lab that held the suppressor that I needed to deal with the clones.
I didn't have the equipment to tackle this mission or to deal with the mutants and the monolith that are there so I decided to go back to get more fire power, during this long walk back and I tried to save my game and I can't try again nope. So now every time I die in game it puts me right back at the lab and can not save my game and  have died to bloodsuckers many times now and back to the lab I go!

"After completing the game with 1 of 4 endings, and having put 80+ hours into the game, pretty much exploring all the map, I must say... this game it's a roller coaster of emotions, you can go from the best shooter with tons of lore and good narrative... to the most unfair and repetitive experience. I played the game in the highest difficulty and oh boy... it's so amazing how poorly the AI is made, so much so, that they will headshot you from across the map with you not being able to see from where they are shooting you, and not only that, but shoot you 4 times with a 2 barreled shotgun before their reload animation kicks in. The beginning is fast and more action sided then the previous games in the franchise, the graphics are completely beautiful, it's something to expect as it was made in Unreal Engine 5, BUT THE BUGS, oh man the bugs... they can pop up at any time, and on anything, from being soft locked on a mission because a mission item didn't spawn, to falling off the map just because, it doesn't happen that often, but it will happen enough times for you to notice it. Besides the bad, the whole experience was good, the anomalies are deadlier than ever, the mutants are a real threat (and sometimes too god damn spongy), the item system is very well thought, and the gun play, has to be the best from the series, although, there comes a moment in the game where you will probably just be swapping between 2 to 3 guns, between shotguns, pistols, SMG's, AR's, Sniper Rifles, A SINGLE LIGHT MACHINE GUN and Gauss cannon (looking at all the previous Stalkers, specially Shadow Of Chernobyl where you could miss a shot even being point blank to an enemy and the pistol wouldn't do any damage). It's a must play if you like survival-ish type of games, open worlds with vasts amounts of lands and lore to discover, and a post apocalyptic setting. But, be advised, that even thought they have released some major updates (and another big one is coming pretty soon according to the devs themselves) the game has some issues, some are very mild, and some are very big you can't miss them. As of this moment, the optimization for rendering tools is there, but not in the best state, and I highly recommend that if you have a good enough PC, DO NOT USE DLSS or FSR, developers have to learn their poor optimization must be seen and they can't just ignore it because AI will kind of fix it. Overall, if I had to give it a score, it would be an 8/10",positive
"Got this game free as a promotion so came in with no expectations whatsoever. This game is buggy, the performance is horrible, and the worst part is it isn't fun. Bullets do no damage whilst the player is very squishy and dies easily, stealth just doesn't work. I have heard that the studio is facing difficulties due to the war in Ukraine so I can't blame them too much and hope to return to this game when it is functional and amend my review. Until then I will be uninstalling and cannot not recommend this game for free or paid to anyone.

"I give it a 6.5 out of 10. I had to add so many mods to make this game playable to my liking, there was no way I was going to carry a handful of items at crawling speed only to sell them for a few credits. I loved the world and missions.",positive
"One of the biggest let downs; Just echoing the terrible performance and optimization which is just the average Unreal game at this point. A lot of weird gameplay choices that just make the game feel bad like the mouse aim. I'd recommend downloading Anomaly on ModDB for free, I think you'll have a better stalker experience.",negative
"game is a buggy mess with disappointing AI, after the latest update it now crashes on every startup",negative
"This game is clearly a labor of love. The ""soundscape"" coupled with top-notch visuals makes for some AMAZING immersion and it's easy to just get lost exploring the Zone. The experience swings between pensively trying to solve obstacles to your progress, avoiding the various anomalies, to getting ambushed and having to fight for your life in a frenetic gunfight that you hadn't planned for. I have yet to complete the game, but I'm loving every minute so far.",positive

"Excellent game, great graphics if you have the system to run it properly with DLSS. I myself ran this on ultra at max settings at 2k (1440p) with an RTX 4060Ti, i7 12th gen. It ran perfectly fine at about 80-100 FPS. Greatly optimized along with some minor issues with framedrops with rarely occur.",positive
"Without bugs, they're just Zones features.",positive
"the passion that made the first stalker games is gone. elements that made the open world feel alive and immersive in the original are broken or simply not present. having a fancy graphics engine that runs like shit is not a good substitute for a satisfying gameplay loop. the entire experience feels hollow, as if someone traced over the visuals/mechanics from the original and attempted to bring the shallow copy to life without understanding what made them so great and unforgettable to begin with.",negative
"I’ve been waiting for patches since release, but so far, not much has changed. This is still a cool tech demo, but not a game worth €60.

Even putting aside the awful optimization, the bugs and completely brain-dead AI ruin the experience. It’s hard to stay immersed when every couple of hours you have to Google a fix for a broken quest or some technical issue. And even when everything works, the world feels lifeless: NPCs just respawn near you, they have no unique loot, no personality.

This game offers one of the most detailed open worlds in recent years, but it feels like a generic corridor shooter, where NPCs exist just to be shot at.

Unfortunately, STALKER 2 is something I might return to in a year or two. For now, I had to reinstall Call of Pripyat with the Gunslinger mod—and I’m enjoying it way more, even on my third playthrough.",negative
"Amazing game, I enjoy the how they show the abandoned bus stations and the vehicles. Different locations, buildings perfectly describe the Soviet Ukraine. Even nowadays you can find the same pieces of history on the roads in Ukraine, in particular near the small villages.",positive
"I have tried, I really have tried to like this game but i just can't. There are just so many bugs and overall issues with the game. Several quests have spawn bugs where essential items don't appear. I have good hardware but looking at any main NPC lags my game to a crawl (literally like 5-10 FPS). It is just too much troubleshooting for not enough fun. It has good atmosphere and when it works correctly is beautiful, but I don't have the time to deal with all its issues and still enjoy the game in a 2 hour period. There are also several in game mechanics and balancing issues that are just not fun. Why does Skif's Makorov starting pistol do more damage than a 45 ACP pistol? Why does it do more damage than an AKM? It is just not worth it to buy this game. 41 hrs in a single playthrough and I still haven't beaten the main story because it just sucks to play.",negative
"The game by itself is good and playing it (if playable!) could even be a unique experience. However as so many mentioned already there tons of technical problems and insanely huge updates that make the overall experience exhausting to say the least.

Right now I'm frustrated, disappointed, and mad because of yet another big update that keeps me from playing... again.

So I'm gonna uninstall it and wait until the day it's finally stable and wish the developers luck!",negative
"Still needs a lot of efforts to be an excellent game, that`s why, unfortunatelly, I can not recommend it now.",negative
"In simple words?

The game is loads of fun, perfect atmosphere, sound design and music, loved everything about the game

My encounters with bugs (anomalies) are nothing game breaking that required hard resets or something, all bugs i had were weird character acting and some minor graphical issues.

The real issue is the FPS, the game... isnt really polished in that department, i had FRS enabled without any upscaling and i had stable FPS , but without it, it woukdve been between 30-45 fps and i dont own a beast GPU its an AMD 6650XT but i should still be able to play it at least 60 fps in high on 1080p but i assume this will be fixed soon as they so far fixed many bugs.

As a stalker fan of the old games i recommend this one!",positive

"Have never played a game in this franchise. Running on a pretty decent PC setup. So many bugs, game is in a state that it is very hard to enjoy. Suffered through all the way to the end after being denied a refund. Upon completion you don't have the opportunity to go back out into the zone unless you go back to a previous save. Frustrating, would not recommend in current state.",negative

8/10 would go to zone again. only downside is too many anomalies(bugs),positive
Best game ever made!,positive
really makes you feel like batman...,positive
Original games are goated. However this game needs some serious work before it even compares. Two of the biggest issues right now it feels like is optimization and gameplay. However an optimized game with bad gameplay is still a bad game. Currently the a life sucks and the overall zone just feels dead and pointless. It actually blows my mind how a game from 2007 has better ai than this. Right now this game is not worth ordering and anyone telling you otherwise is most likely coping. Personally I also don't really like the more arcade shooting and colorful style compared to the more gray and depressing aesthetic of the  old games but that's just personal opinion.,negative
"Really wanted to like this game but it just pales in comparison to the original.  

AI is utterly awful in every single aspect of the game as of the date this was posted - the patch fixes so far have primarily revolved around optimising the game for those that have been unable to run it or are suffering from severe drops in fps, but have done next to nothing on AI (this vid highlights a lot of the current issues which go beyond mere bugs https://youtu.be/t1zM3ePkYPo).

Main quests are alright but the side quests are for the most part, boring and not particularly well thought out, I think the terrible English voice acting affects this in part - I switched to Ukrainian almost immediately.  Characters you come across are all equally forgettable and the game does not manage to capture the feeling of isolation you feel in the first game, nor does it bring that feeling of relief when you finally come across another stalker or would be ally.    

Even on the hardest difficulty the game is too easy, difficulty is just determined by how much ammo it takes to kill monsters which isn't really an issue once you get an auto shotgun, which can be obtained pretty early on.  There are also way too many hidden supply bags throughout, about 1/3 into the game I think I had something like 200 pieces of bread and 150 bandages and medkits, if you're going to try and build suspense in a horror fps, that's going to be severely mitigated if I don't ever have to worry about supplies.  The devs have tried to offset this by making repairing items cripplingly expensive, but all it does is ruin the flow of the game.

I think that's the main issue, the game doesn't flow at all, there are just too many areas that either feel unfinished or are still so buggy it ruins the game play.

Play the first games + the add ons with mods - even after 15 years they are still some of the best games I've ever played. 

Come back to this in a years time, hopefully it'll be a lot better, my money is on the modding community rather than the devs.",negative
"Sigh... it pains me to leave a negative review because i love the s.t.a.l.k.e.r. universe, but this game needs A LOT of work and changes which im hoping the devs will be doing soon and not later.. boring AI, that for lack of better words don't exist naturally in the games world, they're either mindlessly hanging around the settlements doing basically nothing or they're spawning near you while you're running to your next quest and sniping you like aimbots even with shotguns.. disappointing lighting with bad ghosting, terrible performance, you lose any ""drive"" to explore after a certian point, im at a point now where all im doing is making a bee line to the next main quest. hopefully in the near future i can change my review to a positive one. :(",negative

"Stalker: Shadow of Chernobyl was released in the distant past of 2007 and is very much a product of its era. It’s a game of the type and genre that doesn’t really exist, not since the immersive sim became fully enamoured with the story-heavy, narrative focused 0451-style pushed by the Deus Ex’s and Bioshock’s of the world. For me, Stalker is a foundational text of my own history as a gamer. While anyone who tells you that they are bringing you an “objective” or “unbiased” review of a game is either an idiot or a liar, I cannot pretend that I can approach Stalker 2: Heart of Chernobyl, without baggage.

Full review: https://www.vgamingnews.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl/",positive
"So I have to be honest... 

I'm not really finished with the story yet, but I'm having so much fun with the game that I throw myself into it almost every day. 

I actually have a constant 110-170 FPS on the Highest Settings. Everything maxed out. I've had no big crashes so far. Except in Rostok there were 2-3 times with traders or 2 times with the personal crate. However, I have learned to simply press F5 1 more time.

I only had one gamebreaking bug, where I was able to fix it by loading the safe file from 5 minutes before. 

Atmospherically and the general feel of the game is definitely very close. 

I'm going to finish the game now and then probably play it again on the hardest level with a different path. 

As it is now, I can only say that I love the game.",positive
"After the most recent patch the game has become unplayable for me. There’s something that’s messing up my entire computer bc no matter what I change in the games setting, after about 15 minutes the game consumes 99% of my 32gb of system ram. I can’t even open task manager to force close it so I have to restart my computer every time. Was a fun game despite all the other bugs but now it’s just completely broken.",negative

"Stalker 2 is a realistic eastern European survival simulator where you get thrown into the Chernobyl exclusion zone after you forgot to pay Vasily the insurance money on your home. Stuck in this treacherous wasteland with your fellow gopniks you are tasked with gathering funds to pay to the state so they do not reposes all your belongings.

Stalker 2 is to gaming what a life time supply of fentanyl is to the average crackhead.

On a side note, it would be great if the game could run at a proper frame rate. i do no in fact enjoy my frame rate the same as my PowerPoint presentations

"Long time STALKER fan, but can't recommend the game in this state (will change this review if/when game is actually playable). Patch 1.1.4 has (again) introduced performance issues and taken a game that had annoying bugs into unplayable territory. I'm resigned to waiting until the next patch and hoping they solve the issue this time around- for me, stuttering was fixed in 1.1.1 and then performance broken again in 1.1.3 and made worse with 1.1.4 (running a 3060 on medium settings, not exactly trying for ultra graphics).
The omniscient mob spawns that sight you through a forest or shoot through cover are another constant annoyance (mutants I can handle, this is just broken).
If i'd known it was going to be this bad I've had waited a year or more before purchasing. 

In it's praise it is incredibly atmospheric and (once you turn off the ridiculous British voice overs and restore the Ukraine audio) very engaging. Weapons *feel* right when fired and the additions to the zone from the other STALKER games fit right in and add to the experience. The open world, combining all previous games' maps into one seamless area is fantastic and returning to certain areas comes with a dose of nostalgia and sometimes sadness.
[spoiler] looking at you, Clear Sky [/spoiler]  

In it's current and likely future state, don't purchase. Really hoping to be able to change this review. Bugs/oddities I don't mind (since when was STALKER ever free of bugs? They were half the fun), but gameplay breaking performance and stuttering just doesn't cut it.

"Bought it after a few patches, haven't had much issues described in other reviews. Once had to restart after I pressed multiple menus at the same time accidentally and it started lagging but that's mostly it.",positive
Paid $110 for an absolute buggy fucking mess. Crashes indefinitely only question is when it'll finally happen again. 60% of the time if you're using a controller it just flat out wont detect it right off rip even though the rest of your PC can utilize it just fine. Constant quest bugs some of  which PREVENT YOU FROM BEING ABLE TO SAVE THE GAME THAT CRASHES CONSTANTLY. Absolutely infuriating and every patch they release does NOTHING to solve a single issue. If this ever changes I will update this review but I do not see that happening. Stay away from this overpriced pile of shit. The anomaly concept is stupid anyway and will break your immersion every time you come across one.,negative
after playing for more than 10 hours this game is still hard on the easy diff still not even half way through the game i recommend watching a few tuts on yt before purchasing the game as this game is quite hard for new people who wants to play stalker type of games all in all stalker 2 is really fun exploring and doing quest,positive
"Another cyberpunk-like game, u should just wait another 2 years to complete it for playable condition.

"For a S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game, it think its fine. Feels a bit more engaging story-wise than previous games, though I've never been a fan of survival-shooters really. I think the universe is cool and kind of always have, though I think that is cause I played Metro 2033 first. There is some decent world-building from what happened after previous games, gunplay is decent though repair system is very costly. Its fine once you start gathering artefacts and doing more side missions but still a bit of a grind. 

All in all, not a terrible game but not one I'm going to sing too many praises about.",positive
The last mission of this game is terrible and made me change my whole perspective on the game. I enjoyed the open world and some of the missions but that final part sealed the deal of me not wanting to play this ever again.

"Game does not run well I'll be real, however there are few games that make walking around a desolate environment feel captivating and somehow relaxing yet tense at the same time.

"I would give STALKER 2 a 7/10 currently. Mostly good but glaring issues. The regular updates help instill faith in the community but they should release a roadmap of updates and DLC.

The Good:
- Gunplay is fun and the combat is decently challenging. I will say some guns need buffing. 
- Aesthetically pleasing map with historical references.
- With a bit of ingenuity, you can go anywhere on the map from the start and the guide system (fast travel for pay) is very convenient to deal with the large map.
- You can play this game for a long time. 

The bad:
- Prone to crashing and other bugs.
- You can soft and hard lock yourself in the right circumstances. You could lock yourself in an area with no way out or turn in a quest but can't progress further because the giver thinks you're still on that quest. Quest markers will also stay on your map sometimes.
- Enemy AI is a mess. You have regular enemies that can snipe you with a shotgun or throw a grenade perfectly and mutants without cool animations (e.g. Bloodsuckers don't feed on blood or have injury animations.) 
- At end game, everyone gets an exosuit. Makes weaker guns unviable.
- Freedom and Duty are basically just repeatable quests. Sad. 
- Unlike the claim ""several endings"", there are only 4. Also, is no free roam past the final mission.

The debatable:
- You will spend the bulk of your money on repairing your gear. It can br viewed as additionally challenge or a pain.
- The story is pretty middle of the road. Plenty of fan favorite characters though.
- Survival elements are neither intrusive or challenging. Kinda just there. It does make some encounters more fun when you fight while falling asleep.",positive
"Played game on Stalker diff:
Great game.  Awesome atmosphere.  Pretty great story.  Intense fights, really makes you spare ammo; and make good decisions regarding what to upgrade, what not to upgrade.

The artifact implement is ok...progression of artifacts could have been much better.  Repair costs are pretty rough to deal with.  I feel like they could do so much more with this....

Very immersive game, really gets you sweating, head on a swivel this game makes you act fast to bad situations.

and...

Then you start dealing with some of the bugs towards the end of the game, and one base that i wont mention....not a good experience for some of the game because of this.

I give it a 3.5 out of 5, if there weren't any BAD bugs, this is a solid 4.5 game.",positive

"As someone who immensely enjoyed Cyberpunk on launch in spite of the of numerous issues, I am very charitable/have a high tolerance for bugs and crashes. I am also aware and sympathetic to the real world plights and hardships the studio faced during development, but the amount of crashes in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl is truly unacceptable for a full price game.

"IF you like looting water, vodka, and the same broken weapons off every enemy you kill this game is for you, Despite being (open world) you are not going to explore anything because you will have almost everything the current zone has to offer within 10 kills. You take down a base, enjoy that low to mid tier med-kit / energy drink as your reward in the loot stash. Watch the youtube videos, there is a limited and poor selections of guns, with maybe 1-3 different possible weapon drops per zone. The game feels linear as you will not have much ammo to fight off enemies if you choose to explore a lot. I found a gun by accident (ak with a scope) and found out later it was a quest gun, so it wasn't even exploration loot.
The 2-d indie bootleg version of stalker is much better (zero sievert). You can do things with loot (base upgrades, make ammo, etc) enemies drop a wider variety of guns with several different types of attachments which you can take off and put on guns you like more.",negative

Performance isn't amazing for a fairly empty game, A-Life feels anything but alive (mods make the spawn distance a little better but still feels like it's just annoying bloodsucker ambushes 90% of the time), AI is janky beyond what you'd expected of stalker - imbalanced in both directions. Voice acting is wooden.

My biggest gripe - there's not nearly enough side content. The poor A-life doesn't help, but the world just feels empty overall, just littered with some stashes that mostly don't have anything particularly interesting.",negative
UE5 causes the game to have a memory leak every third death and drops the game performance to 1/3rd of its usual speed. The game becomes impossible to play at less than 30 fps.

"This game stands out as one of the best I have ever played. The narrative is outstanding—every choice feels impactful, and the Ukrainian audio adds an authentic layer of immersion. The additional quests are incredibly engaging, further enriching the overall experience.

The gameplay is straightforward yet captivating, inviting both newcomers and veterans to explore its depths. The game world itself is remarkably immersive, bolstered by impressive sound design. Even the streamlined version of the in-game life simulation contributes to creating unique, memorable situations.

On the technical side, the performance leaves much to be desired. While frequent issues can break the immersion—especially during the later stages—it's important to note that there are no hard or soft locks, so these bugs are non-critical. In fact, many of the glitches are amusing and sometimes add a quirky charm to the overall atmosphere.

Overall, despite its technical shortcomings, I would rate this game a solid 9 out of 10.",positive

This game captures the charm of the previous titles, staying true to it's very unique formula (down to the janky gameplay/bugs) and it won't be holding your hands, it's the Zone out there afterall and it's not meant to be forgiving.

"Imho currently far from being balanced - especially combat system and movement issues are spoiling the gaming experience.

- NPCs show no reaction on severe hits, as long as they have some HP left. No manstopping at all. 

- Sneaking feels like rolling a dice. When approaching an enemy, he's  obviously triggered by the player's closeness. 

- The controls feel kind of ankward, often there's no reaction at all when releasing / pushing a movement key (preferences switched to hold/release of course).

- Sometimes the char seems to need some kind of breaking distance, even when sneaking. He then does 1-2 additional steps when releasing the direction key, Very annoying, when approaching an edge or sneaking towards a room full of enemys to suddenly find yourself exposed.

"Its S.T.A.L.K.E.R, we all love S.T.A.L.K.E.R.  The biggest plus for me is the feeling these games give you, they make you feel truly alone in this bizarre world and I think that feeling is what I chase so often, to feel truly alone.  None of these people are your friends they are just around you, you can take time to feel togetherness, but in the end you are a loner, like so many others are, that's what brings you together, being alone.  The Gunplay is nice, it's arcadey on the side of reloads and stuff like that, while being realistic in combat somehow, the damage you do is the damage you receive and I can appreciate that.  The A-life system works well enough, glitches are prevalent, but it makes sense when you understand that the developers are fighting a war at the moment, but they try their best to fix them, which I can appreciate. In the end though I find myself chasing the feeling, I don't know if it's because I'm a husband and stepfather or I'm just a depressed hermit looking for that loner feel, but I know one thing, I'm a loner and I've got a dream, regardless of who crosses my path, I am alone, and my dreams are beautiful and attainable. Thank you, S.T.A.L.K.E.R, and thank you GSC Game World, for making me feel free.",positive
"Honestly, I don't remember the previous STALKERs well, though I played them all. And in the time between, many things happened in my life and I lost the will and skill to play.

"I'm not gonna type 50 sentences to say what has been said many many times in the reviews. Although buggy and to the point of being annoying at times, the game has a very good foundation and hopefully becomes even better with further updates. At this moment I wouldn't recommend playing it without mods (Performance tweaks, better gunfights etc.) I personally played with infinite weight and free repairs as it simply made the game feel and play better. The story can get pretty confusing (even more if you never played the previous titles). Still enjoyed my time overall.",positive
this is game of the year hands down need optimizations badly great stability update was released and shader compiling went smooth loved it the only thing i would suggest is the bringing back of the mutant guide alot of players these days havent played the originals and if you havent go pick them up its the best story ive had to play in a long time well worth the money no triple A game can hold a light to the story telling and immersive story being told,positive
14 years for this??? Just go buy the older titles as they are somehow less broken or at least more forgivable due to price and age. I love this series but I find this entry very broken and kinda boring albeit very beautiful looking. Stalker 2 does capture the atmosphere and aesthetics of the old stalker games very much but the bullet sponge mutants and boring loot/economy really hurt this game not to mention the horrendous bugs & glitches. I had a glitch so bad it locked me out of the main quest from the actual quest just breaking and making it impossible to get any updates or progression.,negative
"This game is awful. It's so dated it feels like playing the original 15 years ago. The graphics are nothing special, it runs terribly even on a 14900k and a 3090. Constant crashes, poor AI and extremely boring. It's a waste of money. Wait till it's £5 in a sale.",negative
"Incredibly charming game with an insanely huge world to explore, the soul from the previous STALKER games is there but it's just too scuffed right now to properly recommend it. ""but it's STALKER, they're not bugs they're anomali-"" shut the **** up troglodite, having major story quests not working/breaking is neither fun nor intended. At least the memory leak issues seem to have been fixed as of patch 1.1.4 so the game performs much better than it did at launch (and for a good while after that). Just wait for the issues to get ironed out before buying it, it's a game that deserves to be properly enjoyed.",negative
So many bugs at the game...,negative
"I always loved the Stalker games, and thats why I played though this game too.
Graphics is good and the ambient is amazing, but the gameplay does not go as I resumed how it would be.

- There is no feeling of that the NPC's lives their life in the same area, they just spawn everywhere and do exact the same things every time. In town they stand or sit talking, and in the wilderness they just spawn and fight either each other or against monsters. And they always spawn close, so you never will have the fun with a sniper to pick em out from distance.
- There are a lot of loot and upgrades, which is a cool way to upgrade your character for the endgame. Problem is that it is a waste of time, since endgame you get all you need and even loot that is better than the rest of the game, so you can literally run through the main story with the simplest stuff and still have the equipment to win the final stages. 
- The anomalies you can pick up has pros and cons most of them, which is interesting, but there where almost so littel good buffs from the anomaly artifacts, so there was really never any point to gather them for better stats, just to sell them for some cash so you can buy ammo. But ammo was never a problem anyway, so going artifact hunting didn't give me any reward worth the time doing it.
- If you are fps player and know how to take out the enemies and the monsters, you can easily do that with the regular weapons that falls in your hands all the way to the endgame. So all the exploration or loot rewards gives very little reward for the playthrough itself.

If you wanna test your GPU and look at the nice scenery and feel the ambience, this is a great game. If you look for a deep gameplay and build up your character that gives a meaning for the endgame, then you should look for something else.

Sorry for my bad grammar.
",negative
"tldr: If you play a lot of early access and are bug tolerant, solid offering at 8/10. If that isn't tolerable for you 5/10

It's a good one, with some conditions. The game is clearly unfinished. Objectively. The deeper you get into the game the more you'll start to find things missing... audio clips that don't play are the most obvious. Lack of polish is also on display throughout but in particular with the fight at the end of act II. FPS fell to near-unplayable levels. I was only able to complete it due to the AI bugging out and not spawning the adds it was supposed to. During act III increasingly there would be enemies spawning clipped into walls and, frequently, clipped into each other. Rarely you can accidentaly collect a quest item too early and it despawns breaking things down the line. All side stuff, not game ending, but annoying. If you can't look past those issues, give it some time and check back.

If you can deal with all of that, this is a solid, story driven shooter set against a backdrop that doesn't get a lot of attention in gaming. Most of the characters are morally dubious or hypocritical that feels... real? There is no ""good guys"" in this game, it's about perspective. The result is a story rich zone with some novel mechanics from artifacts. Weight limitations force you to either make meaningful choices about the amount of weapons and ammo you carry or lose mobility which will just get you killed. I played on Veteran difficulty and while I can respect the complaints I've seen about bullet sponge enemies, durability felt reasonable once I figured out what the correct tool for each job was. Similarly with the complaints of aimbot AI, moving evasively and carefully mostly deals with that. This is part of what I mean by adapting to the zone. This is not Fallout. On that point, when you step up to the next ""tier"" of weaponry you feel the power spike, same with armor tiers. I would have preferred a more gradual increase in item effectiveness rather than the distinct steps up that exist here but it's okay.",positive
"Technical issues, dodgy performances, missing features, BLATANT visual downgrade compared to the early promotional material, slow support.

"Its the exploration in the atmosphere of constant danger and tension for me. The best parts are when you randomly stumble on some anomaly puzzle or short npc quest where you have to make tough decision. 
I love that the game doesn't always award you for ""good"" choices, and you can easily miss on some juicy equip, by taking the high road, which makes decision-making much more realistic and interesting.
There are still some things to polish here and there, but I haven't had any critical problems so far.",positive
"Good Hunting, Stalker!",positive
"Bruv, This game is perfect even though many people say the NPCs in the old game are superior...
But what I like about this new stalker game is the nostalgic gun animations, smooth cutscenes (better than Dying Light 2, The Zone.

It's not perfect but it's not bad either. I'm still waiting for a developer update to fix the enemy accuracy. Man, they're so annoying and seems they got tone of granat to trow at me to death, also hope for another performance update.   Overall its good.",positive

"Currently, the game is unable to be played fully without modifications. 

While I have thoroughly enjoyed what I have played so far, I cannot recommend this game due to game breaking bugs. I have gotten to a point where I am trapped inside a complex and am unable to progress because a flash drive won't spawn. I have looked up solutions, all of which tell me to revert my save (Which has not worked for me) or use console commands which you have to install separately and put into your files. I personally do not like messing with game files out of fear of corrupting the games files. 

I bought this on release and got stuck in that complex mid December and it took them a month to drop the first patch of the game. The part that irks me about the patch is that they didn't put down a full list of the patches and only stated ""Long story short"" while putting three to four lines of updates. This has led to me retrying all the ""fixes"" the community had posted to no avail, withstanding the console commands. Everything else about this game is thoroughly enjoyable and I really want to finish the game, but of course I'm still waiting on a patch. I will update the review once my problem is fixed, which hopefully I won't forget what is actually happening story-wise by the time the fix is posted.",negative

I understand the difficulties the developers have experienced in making this game, and whilst it is an unfortunate situation, in the end it doesn't excuse releasing this product in an unplayable state.

I will no doubt revisit this title in a couple of years time, after 20+ patches or so. Just like i did with the original stalkers series.

"This has to be one of the worst games I've ever played. 

The game loop consists of getting a task that is always go here kill this thing or some person or clear a group. Come back for some pennies that you can't buy anything with. You move like sloth in a big world having to run from place to place (no vehicle). 

The story is not interesting at all. 

The combat is soooooo bad. Enemy variety consists of 3 types. People that you can one shot hit on the head, hoards of animals that you have to dump all your resources on and trigger the same stupid animation where you have to get up from the ground, and some weird one that ""grabs"" you from a distance and just walks around. 

Game world is filled with traps that look great, function fine, add to the impressiveness and all that jazz but if you get bored like me you just learn that you can just load up on meds and jab yourself to the finish line. Everything is just tall grass where you can't see wtf is shooting at you with pin point accuracy.

AI is asssssss. Things just spawn. For no reason. I can't tell you how many times I've turned around and SEEN a pack of dogs spawn in front of my eyes.

"Really good game.
But
It does need some patches to fix some stuff. The most important issues right now are:
1:Bugged main quest (i had to enable cheats to bypass it)
2:enemy AI can hit you with a shotgun in pitch black dark behind a bush from 10km away (although they deal no dmg because of the distance it's annoying af)
3: and lastly if the shaders bug is still happening for some people it needs to be fixed.
4: this is for my preference but for me the game doesn't feel like a survival game at all. I never run out of ammo or food. I was even selling Food and ammo for cash most of the time.
I played on the highest difficulty hoping the game will be more survival like but nah, I never needed to worry about Food/drinks or ammo for the entire game.

One last thing i want to see is some weapon balancing. I am not going to list everything but the number 1 thing that i want to see is:
The skif's pistol is way to strong makes every other pistol in the game obsolete. And on top of that you can't even remove it from your inventory. Literally you have no reason to use any other pistol in the game (ignore Rhino (best weapon in the game btw))",positive

veri god,positive
"Its good, not amazing but if you want great gunplay a decent story go play it",positive
"This is a really strange game that feels like it is some sort of artistic interpretation rather than a game.

Almost everything you do has you asking the question ""but why?"" There doesn't feel like there is any reason to do anything. You kill enemies to get money to buy bullets to kill more enemies. You can just walk by the enemies if you want, it doesn't make a difference. Some people might argue this is part of the games charm because it gives you a choice, but I feel like it means the opposite - that your choices don't matter at all.

Stalker 2 is filled with quirks that are often times frustrating. Tons of bugs on top of an already janky experience make it difficult to understand what is intentional. Often times enemies will spawn out of nowhere right on top of you, especially when progressing quests. It is obviously a quest mechanic that they want you to get ambushed, but the problem with this is 10 enemies spawning right on top of you, all with exact knowledge of your location, means you're just standing in corner berserker firing into a pile of enemies and spamming medkits. 

There's almost no way to play as a stealthy character because enemies seem to always be aware of your position. Even if you pick off a single enemy from behind with a silenced pistol, an entire base will come crashing down on you relentlessly. It always turns into a massive firefight. Additionally, roaming enemies have an immense area of vision and will engage you from across the map. Their aim is incredibly good as well. 

The story gives off the appearance of some nuance because it doesn't explain every little detail of the story and it also puts your character into some immoral and selfish positions, but it's all surface-level and could be argued that it's more of an oversight than design. For example, there is a quest chain that emphasized mercy on a specific enemy type. Later, you encounter swarms of these enemies. I decided to not kill any of them in hopes I would be rewarded for showing ""mercy."" There is absolutely no acknowledgement of this action in dialogue or throughout the quest. To top it off, there are quite a few moments where some really ridiculous ""accidents"" happen, such as letting the bad guy stand right next to the exact thing you don't want to let him stand next to just to make sure the plot continues.

The worst part to me is the amount of running. You will genuinely run for 3 minutes straight as you go from one side of the zone to the other from quests. Many areas will have impassible ""one way in, one way out"" type of designs, such as an extremely long cliff face, which will force you to run a significant distance to be able to cross over. Your stamina depletes rapidly, encouraging you to drink consumables to recover that lost stamina. If you don't keep a significant number of these drinks on you at all times, you will have some incredibly long and slow journeys across empty and meaningless space. This compounded by the remarkably low carry weight, which means you will not be able to loot much of what you take from kills. And running back to where all the items are is just an unreasonable time sink. This makes you leave behind a significant amount of loot, which loops back to the ""but why?"" issue at the beginning. 

The final nail in the coffin is the end quest. Without spoilers, I will tell you the balance is WAY off. Enemies will endlessly spawn on a single-file walkway that you have to navigate through. What makes this worse is the enemies will literally spawn right in front of you. You can shoot an enemy and his replacement will spawn right on top of the old guy's corpse. You will be shot at so rapidly that you cant even get a medkit applied before you're eliminated. It is absolutely ridiculous. I tried for 30 minutes to get through one segment and just decided to give up. It's just not even worth it.",negative
Amazing that they've managed to recreate the feeling of the original games. 10/10,positive
"The only ones who recommend this game are the ones who never played Shadow of Chernobyl, because the only thing that this Stalker 2 is better in is graphics.... thats just all.

I still remember the  first time when i encountered the Bloodsucker in Shadow in Chernobyl, my heart was pumping like mad, every encounter with Bloodsucker was something extraordinary, but here in this game? Its your first enemy you encounter and you will meet them every 5 minutes. Where is the immersion? I dont feel like being part of the Zone, in Shadow of Chernobyl you could see the distance with your binoculars, you could scout the next location like that and prepare for the encounter...but here?

"Stalker 2 comes from a long line up of buggy games, however the lack of care or concern about the fundamentals of stalker. the A life system is broken and isnt even built to work properly, the mutants dont have any dynamic interactions, such as a hunger system like the older games or disbanding when the odds look bad. the game runs terribly because devs relied on upscaling in UE5, the devs cut every corner where possible to cash out on hype while abandoning everything that made the first 3 stalkers appealing. Play stalker GAMMA if you want a good stalker experience",negative
"The game is the latest entry to the S.T.A.L.K.E.R franchise. A great entry with all its recognizable shooter, survival, horror elements. 

You play as Skif, a veteran of the Ukrainian Marine Corps who decides to enter the infamous Zone(the 60 km  exclusion zone that was set up around the Chernobyl NPP following the 1986 disaster, a place full of mutants and anomalies) to solve the mystery behind the destruction of your apartment by an anomaly. 

The best selling point of the game is it's incredibly immersive atmosphere. Nothing sets the mood better then hearing the Stalkers talk/sing in Ukrainian around a campfire, the creepy sounds inside a bunker that slowly infest your soul with anxiety, the awesome-best weather systems i have ever seen in a game that make everything so believable. Many times I found myself taking breaks, immerse myself and just listen to sounds of this beautiful but scary world of the Zone. 

The second best selling point is the fact that game has great replayability. There are plenty of choices to have which have both small or big consequences that will influence the future. Spare someone, save someone, bribe, work for or kill someone, stand with a faction or another. Not sparing someone/kill someone/attack certain people/make the wrong choice could mean not getting help in the future, lose tens of thousands of coupons, not get access to certain faction, lose access to a peaceful resolution, getting another ending and so on. The game really feels realistic and fun. Because you can behave the way you want: good or evil and indifferent, calculated or impetuous, you can be stingy or generous its all up to you.  

Another good aspect is the brutal combat. I played on max difficulty. The game was very unforgiving. I have died enough times and every encounter was very intense, where my focus was needed 100%.  From the fights with NPC human enemies that have pinpoint accuracy, flank you to the almost 2-3 hits deadly-creppy mutants like Pseudogiants, Chimera, Bloodsuckers. The brutality is enforced also by the fact that the Zone is full of very irradiated places/anomalies/radioactive-Psy storms that can kill you in seconds or by the fact  equipment is degrading quickly if you are not good at the game, not careful. But this makes it all more satisfying when you put the time in to get good, learn the mechanics and become a veritable Stalker. 

The gameplay mechanics are well done in the sense that investing in upgrades(armor, weapons), looking for good artifacts, use the appropriate weapons/armors make a great, important change to the gameplay and outcomes. From struggling to dominating the game. From a noob to feeling like an accomplished veteran.  The game has a steep learning curve if you have not played any Stalker games so be careful to maybe read some guides if this is your first game in the franchise. 

The exploration is also great. The game has a huge open world map that can be explored  almost all of it as soon as you finish the intro of the game. Going about and explore is rewarding with meaningful finds: you can find new unique-interesting anomalies spots/artifacts spots, blueprints for weapons/armors, new armors and weapons, new factions with their respective lore and quests. 

The weapons variety is awesome. Tons of pistols, automatic weapons, shotguns, snipers, rocket launcher, grenades with some of the best, satisfying gun animations I have ever seen in a game. Every weapon can be upgraded and almost all can be equipped with silencers, sights&scopes, extended magazines.  

Same is with enemy variety. You fight both groups of humans NPCs, zombies and many interesting mutants which use original and interesting ways of attack not found in other games.  Poltergeists, Controllers, Burers, Psy Dogs use psychokinetic-telepathic abilities(telekinesis, making illusions), Bloodsuckers use camouflage (turning invisible) and ambush techniques, Pseudogiants and Chimeras are build like tanks and have devastating attacks. You also have groups of blind dogs, swarms of rodents, Boars, Fleshes, Snorks, Armoredelks. 

The graphics and visuals are some of the best I have seen in all my gaming experience. Played the game in 4k Epic settings. Took more then 100 screenshots. 

The last thing I wanna mention as positive would be the characters, voice acting and cutscenes which are done well. My favorites are the friendly Richter, the joker like and a bit mad Scar, the mysterious Faust, the compassionate and wise Dr. Kaymanov, off course the badass Strelok and the infamous Sidorovich.  It will always remained imprinted in my memory the first time I encounter Strelock and the way he told me in the most badass way: ""Name"". 

There are some bad things that ruin the experience and that would be the economy which is a bit unbalanced(upgrades and repairs are too expensive), some quests are broken, the AI respawn/A-Life need some work and the performance is kind of rough. 

Overall the game is great with the well known Stalker great atmosphere, realistic/brutal gunplay and gunfights, unforgiving gameplay, good horror elements in a creepy way, some of the best visuals and realistic-immersive weather effects, great exploration, top-notch voice acting and badass characters but with some few negative things that can ruin things.

"I would love to recommend this game but wait for some more patches.

There are still issues with lots of permanently stuck quest items weighing down the inventory.
They are marked as quest items so you cannot drop them or put them in stash.
They are bugged so they are not useful anymore, this means there is no way to get it OUT of the inventory by handing it to anyone.
They have weight, if you are gonna limit the ability to get a rid of these items at least make them weigh nothing so it does not impact the game.

As it is the quest items build up, currently I have 6 of them in my inventory and at least 3 are never going to leave.

Please address this, I would love to keep playing but every time I open my inventory I get frustrated at the number of items floating in there weighing me down I can do nothing about.

The number of bugs in this game is staggering. Many gameplay mechanics feel lacking and unreasonable-especially the in-game economy, where you have to pay an absurd amount just to repair your gear, and upgrading it is even more frustrating. Ammo and attachments for advanced weapons are scarce and cost a fortune.

Enemy NPCs can see you through every piece of foliage, whether you're behind a wall or a bush, whether it's day or night-they just don't care. They also tend to spawn out of nowhere. Friendly NPCs, on the other hand, are dull and repetitive. They all sound the same, say the same things, and if you try talking to them, you'll either be told to ""fuck off"" or hear some generic nonsense with no real substance.

Quests are mostly annoying, often requiring you to run to the other side of the map just to press the same button or pull a lever to activate something. Many of them feel unoriginal and uninspired, seemingly designed just to make you sink more time into the game.

And this is just the tip of the iceberg. Already, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone except die-hard stalker fans-only they can endure the frustration and somehow enjoy it.",negative
"Buggy mess, enemies have aimbot, wallhack and can see through everything.

"Steam still refuses to give us a rating system so we are stuck with just the 2 options of recommend or not. Utterly ridiculous and STALKER 2 is the perfect reason why. Not only is it a dishonest system because the ""recommends"" count for a positive review, and vise verse, but you can literally say what you want inside Steam's rules in your review. So I can, in theory, recommend this game while saying how awful it is in my review, and the 'All/Recent Reviews' section on a game's info on Steam will only show a positive review. LOL it is laughable and juvenile. 

Anywho, I'd recommend this game, and I'd also say stay away from it. But my review would be mixed then, yeah? So let's start with the cons.

---CONS---: If you played the previous game, you'll notice, immediately, how awful the flashlight is, the lack of binoculars, and the horrible new way to generate enemies, which is to make them spawn only when you are within, I believe, 50M. Not that it matters with the lack of binoculars I suppose. Staring at a blank area isnt cool. You should be able to plan your move(s). They really dumbed this bad boy down and Im not sure why. The reason the first one was such a cult hit that turned in to a mainstream game over which people begged for a sequel, certainly wasn't because we all hated a functioning flashlight, nightvision, binoculars, and the ability to STALK the freakin landscape. Quite the opposite, obviously. 

The game tries way too hard to be difficult, but it's done in a cheap way. This game lacks the charm and polish of, say, Soulsborne games or Ninja Gaiden. Enemies are bullet sponges, even with headshots, and you are not lol. But more importantly, the cheap deaths just reek of ""try-hard"" b.s. by the devs. You lose way too much progress to justify this non sense. Im not saying to give us soulsborne mechanics; Im saying this game shouldnt be any thing even approaching this type of buffoonery. 

See, the deaths arent lessons or the player's failing (to an extent at least on the latter). No, the deaths are cheap and often lame. If get hit by an electrical phenomenon environmental hazard; fine. Shame on me most of the time. But what I dont appreciate is that you dont die completely after a while, but are still stuck in a slowmo stagger and youll get struck again no matter what. Now youre dead. Small example. You can see what Im getting at though, right? Most environmental deaths are just like this. Some kind of cheap and UNAVOIDABLE means to die. Uncool.

And the guns lack a punch. They dont all feel the same when firing, but the end result is still paintballs hitting a person or creature made of metal. 


The graphics are pretty, but way too static. There is almost nothing dynamic. Every thing survives explosions and bullets, in other words (not literally of course, but damn near). This isn't some massive Bethesda RPG or Final Fantasy. Cyberpunk is much more intense and larger than this game, yet you can destroy almost any thing sans walls and skeletons of buildings (steel girders etc). I cannot believe we waited this long for this game only to have it turn out like this lol.

I covered it a little, but you also lack nightvision, as I said above. Might not be the end of the world, but it was very significant before, and this game is dark af. 

Oh and ffs; not another game with a shader compile bs problem. Im running games prettier than this with more scripts and with 100s of mods going, and dont crash or have memory leak errors. And ignore the idiots saying your CPU is why lol. It COULD be the case, but it isn't if you have a competent computer that can handle this game's odd graphics.

And now for the PROS!
-I thought the english voice acing was decent enough, but the Russian and Ukrainian are great...I think. For all I know, ruskies and ukies are like ""what the hell is this crap, im turning on the English/Japanese/German option"". 

-The graphics, as I said, have some MAJOR issues, but overall it's an extremely good looking game with solid animation. 

-The story is ok. I wouldnt list it as a con, that is for sure. You get thrown in to your situation without warning, which I liked, but your character knows about the area and still decides to venture in unprepared, only to have early plot stuff make it even worse on him. Im not asking to be geared up; Im asking devs to stop being so inconsistent in damn near every game. Immersion matters.
However, that is where the complaints end on the story. Your choices matter and you have a bit of leeway with what you do in interacting with people; including killing them. When I play, I find myself very interested in the main story and side quest stories. Which leads me to my next compliment...

The sidequests are pretty good, actually. Sure, there are some fetch quests, but they arent just optional in a literal sense; they actually feel like you arent being forced to do them, punished for ignoring them, and best of all, you don't feel disrespected in the sense that you are a badass and people wouldnt ask you to grab 5 chicken eggs for them 100 feet away in a field. Doesn't happen. Love that. 

The ""creature"" situation is also a meh, but still not enough to not recommend. Some of them look silly; for you old heads like me, think of the ""Real Ghostbusters"" toyline from the late 80s and early 90s and the wild ""haunts"" that were released lol. So it's hit or miss. And the lore is a little loosey-goosey on why we have such profound mutations, every thing stays in the zone, and the govt hasnt put an end to this region. You have to have a suspension of disbelief when it comes to most fiction, especially scifi, medieval fantasy, and video games, but I expect devs to give me a little somethin' to work with. And a ""little somethin"" is all you get with STALKER2, which, as I said, is just meh. But the human interactions are among the best in the biz and i loved the anxiety and wonderment of what each encounter would bring and the freedom you have with many requests and missions you undertake. And that of course is on top of the random encounters which are even better IMO. 

Lastly, the controls could be better, but again not a con. It is what it is. The game is definitley a console game, but more keyboard friendly lol. Pain in the d*** to switch weapons, use weapon wheel, etc, but if you arent playing any thing else at the same time as this, youll get used to it. I do not recommend switching between this and other games with ""item wheels"" lol. 

OVERALL: I give it a 7.5/10, but a few patches could easily fix that.",positive

"This game has pretty good bones and not a lot of polish. There's some quality of life issues like fast travel being sparse and taking a long time to get to, as well as constant need to loot goblin everything, so I recommend a trainer to bypass tedious stuff.

"Great characters.
Missions are good.
Looks awesome and is incredibly atmospheric.
Captures that Stalker feel.
Great lore to read and listen to.

Runs like hot garbage.
Constant bugs necessitating mods.
90% of the game is just running from point a-b in a repetitive loop.
Firefights are awful and unrewarding. (They just spam the position you're at, that is the end all and be all of their capabilities).
AI is terrible. Most mutants just run at you, psychic ones try one attack then just walk away with their back turned..

Outside of the story the game isn't good. It's boring and uninspired and the difficulty is nonexistent. The only difficulty comes from when the game stops playing fair. Choppy framerate, laggy mouse, terrible feeling weapons and aiming. The enemies aren't an issue unless they literally cheat. Most of the time they have zero clue where you are, or they are shooting you constantly through walls and bushes you can't see through, spamming grenades every 5 seconds making scopes essentially useless due to constant bounce and no cover to use. It doesn't feel natural, it doesn't feel fun. It's just the same encounter over and over and over again with the same problems popping up. It loses all originality outside the story within the first 10hrs of gameplay.

The majority of the issues don't appear until well after the first 2 hours of gameplay.

If you want Anomaly with better story and less fun, this is it. I hope they improve it because I WANT this game to be good. It just isn't. The gameplay feels less like Stalker and more like Fallout. A not very good Fallout.",negative

"[b]What's this thing?[/b]
A flawed gem of a game. STALKER 2 is an open-world horror shooter that is comfortably the least scary game in the series, and its combat is chock full of strange balancing and design choices. However, the surreal charms of the original trilogy are all there - and now amplified by the staggeringly beautiful graphics as well as hugely improved production values everywhere. As of January 2025, it's also nowhere near as buggy as the launch version that got somewhat slaughtered by the reviews.

This is the sort of game that shouldn't be great when you look at its individual parts, and yet those parts combine into something seriously memorable and well worth playing - warts and all.

[b]Hits:[/b]
[list]
[*]A wonderful map to explore, and a Skyrim-esque cadence to how you wander, discover, and loot that makes it extremely easy to lose track of time. While environmental storytelling is limited to major landmarks from previous games, the art direction and general vibe more than makes up for it, and both seem to get better and better the deeper you are into the main story.
[*]Very satisfying gunplay [i]most of the time[/i]. Guns feel and sound fantastic across the board, and there are plenty of them to choose from for virtually every scenario except sniping. Each and every weapon can be upgraded and fitted with accessories that can affect your options meaningfully in firefights. The launch version had mutant enemies that were ridiculously difficult to kill, but this was addressed with an early patch and is no longer an issue [i]most of the time[/i]. While human enemies have several major annoying tendencies, they hit hard enough to send you scrambling for cover at the start of every fight - and given how relatively fragile you are, this gives combat a delicious sense of urgency.
[*]Looks mostly incredible thanks to wonderfully evocative lighting, plenty of sharp texture work and fantastic environment design throughout. Strangely for an open-world game set in an uninhabitable space, STALKER 2 looks its best when you're indoor and it's a sunny day outside.
[*]Surprisingly well-directed and well-acted cutscenes. A couple of main story characters (Strider and Col. Korshunov) are genuinely memorable and perhaps deserve more screen time than they actually got. Many of these cutscenes also feature first-person action setpieces directed by Ilya Naishuller - who previously directed the films Hardcore Henry and Nobody - and it really shows in the final product.
[*]Sound design was, in my opinion at least, the single best thing the original STALKER trilogy accomplished - and STALKER 2 lives up to its legacy. This is a game visually and aurally dripping with mood and atmosphere in every moment.
[/list]

[b]Misses:[/b]
[list]
[*]As someone who doesn't do too well in horror games, I actually appreciate how [i]not scary[/i] STALKER 2 is. The original games did a much better job easing you into the Zone's vibes and building up to the first encounter with each new mutant type - and basically all of these first encounters were either pants-****tingly terrifying, memorable, or both. This sequel botches it right from the first few minutes by unceremoniously throwing one of the most feared enemies from the original games right at you in the tutorial. Once you're properly kitted out, all mutants bar the two toughest types no longer pose a serious threat. Also, you can be safe from most of the mutants just by jumping on a crate or a car, but this stupidly sends the weaker enemy types running for cover until you get back down to the ground. With the humanoid enemies, this can be sort of excused, but with rats and blind dogs? That's dumb.
[*]Human enemies, meanwhile, are basically aimbots. They can spot you through foliage and some types of cover, and their aim is laser accurate even with a shotgun from afar. Most of the time, this is just annoying enough to make you cautious in every fight, but this can blow up into a genuine nuisance with encounters at night or in very dark places. It also doesn't help that the flashlight has a very anemic range and can alert enemies to your position when in use, and stealth is basically broken since every enemy knows exactly where you are once one of them spots you.
[*]There are bizarre balancing decisions all around. You progress through STALKER 2's power curve with gear, and it does make sense that gear drops in late-game zones are more powerful. However, for a game that obviously cares enough about its guns to feature multiple ammo types and caliber change options for many firearms, the stat progression is just strange. An SMG shooting pistol rounds can somehow deliver better armor penetration than assault rifles. The starting pistol that you cannot drop is among the best sidearm options in the game and won't be replaced until you're well over halfway into the story. Human enemy AI operates in such a way that renders most sniper and marksman rifles unnecessary. And the two toughest mutant types? Oh boy. Both are downright unfun to fight and require cheesing in some scenarios - including at least two mandatory encounters in the main story.
[*]Several late game areas and landmarks have clearly broken enemy spawn rates. New groups drop in and start shooting within minutes of you clearing the last one out. It's fun for a few minutes and annoying after that.
[*]Fans of previous STALKER games looking for improved A-Life need not apply. As of January 2025, STALKER 2's map is very much alive, but the dynamic-feeling faction clashes and reputation system that the original games had are either half broken or just mostly absent here.
[*]The story is... scattershot and often falls into Capitalized Word Soup territory. The first half of the game throws so many meaningless names and faces at you that you really struggle to care or remember, but then a major story event happens and the writing suddenly becomes so powerful with allusions to real-world historical events. You're pulled back in for a moment, and then you drop out again with more Capitalized Word Soup. That said, all four endings are well written, and each feel just ambiguous enough to feed into the Zone's aura of surreal mystery.
[*]For a game that feels so good to play for so long, the final 2 or 3 hours of the story are not fun at all. STALKER 2 shines when you're exploring forlorn places and thinking on your feet in combat. The story's finale gives up all of the former and tries to focus on the latter but with gimmicky boss fights and a horrible final combat area where at least one enemy appears to have a one-hit-kill weapon that can shoot you through walls.
[*]There has been a lot of criticism for Unreal Engine 5 and its implementation in STALKER 2, and a fair bit of it is warranted. Forced software ray tracing can look amazing, but when it doesn't, it [i]really[/i] doesn't. Some areas have basically broken lighting with grainy shadows cast in the wrong direction. There are light leaks aplenty in indoor areas close to doors and windows, and sometimes the lighting can just look flat for no discernible reason.

[b]Technical stuff:[/b]
[list]
[*]Yet another game that requires scaling tech to run acceptably. While the game runs acceptably enough for me on a 3080, performance dips really hard when you're in safe zones with lots of NPCs around. Supports pairing DLSS with FSR3 frame generation for those of us not blessed with newer Nvidia GPUs.
[*]Launched full of glitches - including a semi-regular memory leak, freezes during launch, huge frame drops around NPCs with hair, hard progression blockers and broken quests - but the situation has improved drastically after patch 1.1 in December. A lot of complaints around broken quests now are from pre-1.1 saves. Starting a new game is not ideal for people who run into major mid-game bugs, but those just starting out should be fine from now on.

"Графика... В одном месте она реально красивая и хочется сделать скриншот, а в другом, всё мерцает, пердит, свестит и глазам тупо больно. Игра сделана на Lumen и это тупо позор, потому что вся геометрия из-за этго для просчёта упрощается настолько, что теней от объектов тупо нет, но они просчитываются же и это минус FPS. В том же Metro Exodus всё аппаратно и FPS на отметке от 50 до 60 всегда.

Оптимизация ужасна. На системе RX 7600, i3-10100, 12GB RAM игра выдаёт 20-40 FPS на любых настройках. Это просто неприемлемо для такого железа. Я понимаю, что проц надо помощнее, да и оперативы маловато, но ребят... Даже Alan Wake 2 у меня и то стабильнее работает, вы чё? А в Alan Wake 2 Mesh Shading. Короче... Обидно, реально обидно. Я бы хотел пройти игру, но в 20 фпс с таким железом... У вас было б желание продолжать вообще?

После патча 1.13 игра полностью перестала запускаться (ошибка на этапе компиляции шейдеров). Мне пришлось ждать месяц, пока разработчики исправят это. Нет, выход был, мод который отключал комплияцию помог мне зайти в игру, но, у меня не было ни объектов, ни текстур, просто ничего. Т.е вдумайтесь, я предзаказал игру, скачал увидел вот такую шнягу, ждал патчей, думал, что хоть как-то зафиксят это чуваки, а на Новый год мне такой подарок сделали, что её тупо запустить не мог и сиди жди месяц.

После патча 1.14 игра наконец запустилась, но… все мои сохранения (17 часов игры) просто исчезли. Начинать заново после такого – абсурд.

Каждый запуск игры сопровождается долгой компиляцией шейдеров (около 3 часов из ""типа наиграоного врмени"" ушло на это).

Steam отказал в возврате денег, несмотря на все проблемы.

"This game broke me. I never ragequited a game before. But this made me do it. The performance is terrible, even though they made attempts to fix many issues, the game is often still barely playable. Everytime a human being appears in the game, the framrate falls into a dark pit and never recovers. Somtimes I had to quit the game because my framerate was at 1 or 2 fps and didn't recover. The story is terribly bland and in combination with the abysmal performance and repetetive gameplay it's even worse. I didn't even finish the game because my game just crashed over and over again and I had to repeat so many things I already did before. Whoever made this game should really rethink the choices they made and maybe consider that the Metro series did everything better than you in every way.

"Not gonna lie it's pretty boring in my opinion. AI enemies are dumb and annoying to fight, combat feels super bad, and most engagements aren't fun at all. I didn't play the first STALKER but this game just feels really outdated in most aspects and poorly executed. For example, traversing over walls and climbing up ledges is janky and sometimes doesn't work at all. Overall, the game feels like it's in early access and needs lots of improvement to be worthy of a $60 price tag. That's close to your AAA game and I just don't feel like this game is anything special. I would like to think this game really appeals to people who played the first one and rubs them the right way when it comes to nostalgia but this game is really lacking in a ton. I really hope people realize that this game isn't what we want the future of gaming to be like.

"To preface- I love STALKER. I've replayed Shadow of Chernobyl in particular an unreasonable number of times. These games feel like a home away from home to me. That's why I'm exceptionally unhappy to say that STALKER 2 is a shell of what I know these games can be.
To be clear, it's really only a disappointment from my perspective, and maybe that of a few like-minded weirdos. I think normal people coming into the series for the first time will be perfectly happy with it- You have your Bethesda-style compass covered in markers, on-screen quest logs with checklists of everything you need to do, button prompts constantly reminding you how to tie your shoes. This version of STALKER is more smooth and streamlined compared to the originals, the friction and rough edges filed off, which is precisely why I just couldn't stay engaged.

STALKER 2's biggest problem, as many have pointed out before me, is its lack of the classic games' A-Life system. In this system, the Stalkers and mutants of the Zone had simulated schedules; they had their own goals and patrols independent of the player. You would hear fights in the distance or see packs of dogs or gangs of bandits wandering the world, not because they were scripted to be there but because you just happened to cross their paths. Now to be clear, this system wasn't perfect, it broke down occasionally (to put it nicely); that would be part of the aforementioned rough edges.

There was unlimited potential for improvement to A-Life, which is why it kills me that in STALKER 2 it is simply nonexistent. I've never wondered at the origin of distant gunfire, or reevaluated the path to my objective because a pack of mutants blocked the way, because those things just don't happen. If there are NPCs in your vicinity outside a designated camp or quest area, it's because they spawned there specifically to fight you like Pokemon in tall grass. This might not be as noticeable to new players, but it feels jarring and hollow when you have the old games to compare it to.

Actually fighting those NPCs also feels worse, which is shocking because the presentation is obviously improved; guns look and sound better, the environments are more detailed, your targets have higher fidelity than ever before- but they're just boring to fight. Enemy AI in the old STALKER games, like A-Life as a whole, was prone to melting down, however it was still capable of being exciting and surprising. When random Stalkers out in the field laid ambushes, pinned me down with suppressing fire, or even fled encounters that weren't going their way, it made the world feel alive. STALKER 2's enemies are not capable of this; they run at you, shoot you, and throw grenades at you. I'm not even sure I've ever seen one try to take cover. They try to make up for this by giving even the most vodka-drunk Bandit the eyes of a hawk and the aim of an elite sniper, but this only adds to the frustration of getting drilled in the head through half a city block of dense vegetation. Mutants suffer a similar problem, with the added frustration that they exist solely to soak up bullets and healing items. Unlike in past games, there are no parts to butcher and sell from mutants. They don't seem to flee or even slow down when wounded like they used to. They're just death blobs that run at you until someone dies. Long story short, combat just isn't as engaging as it used to be.

Finally, the thing that everyone should be able to agree is an objective upgrade to the past STALKER games- the graphics. We're working with Unreal Engine 5 here after all, this is cutting edge stuff! Well, I don't really like it. I'm not going to lie to you and pretend the old STALKER games were better graphically of course- they had solid art direction and good atmosphere, but they didn't really look ""good"" by modern standards. Still, over the decades, modders have proven that the X-Ray engine can still hold its own in the modern world. STALKER 2 suffers from looking great in theory, but in practice is completely reliant on upscaling that turns it into a mess of pop-in and muddled foliage. The original STALKER trilogy may be ugly by modern standards but at least the trees weren't melting, a problem made even more frustrating by recent mods that have proven this setting can be beautiful and readable at the same time.

TL;DR
Normal people will probably like STALKER 2 just fine. The roughness of the originals has been smoothed out, confusing mechanics have been simplified, everything feels very modern, shiny, and streamlined. People like me, who loved STALKER because it was none of those things, who hoped to see the Zone evolve and grow into its potential more than they wanted dynamic puddle reflections, might be disappointed.",negative
Great Game!,positive
"At first I was ""wow this is the GOTY"". It started great. Hit all of the right note. You're a nobody in the zone, just here to make some cash. Game is poorly optimised, often pretty, at times gorgeous. It's very much Call of Prypiat 2024.

Then I started to realize that actually no, it was inferior on all aspects to CoP or any of the other games. You're another ""chosen one after all"". Stories offer you meaningless choices between two obnoxious leader, not acknowledging that you have zero interest in what they offer you. A life is poorer than before, AI is poorer than before, you read on a forum that there will be no night vision google ever, wtf? Key in STALKER.

Still I thought: well this is head of shoulder above all other open world FPS, being an honest stalker.

And it's so big.

Oh my big. Insufferably big.

Walk a lot to grind, Lose money to bugs, missing guide, reputation bugs. Main quest makes you do something big? It costs a fortune, and somehow you have to fund the whole operation (that you give zero f about) on your dime because reason.

The story isn't just ininteresting, it begins to not even make sense. 120h in the game, you have zero idea what you're charachter is even seeking, what's the point of anything. The story holds no mystery, not rythm, you have to use mode to pass game breaking bugs.

And it 

Never

Ends

Jesus. It never ends. The game overstays its welcome and then there is still 20, 30h of ok but I just want to finish this.

And then you have.

Boss fights.

Dear gamedesigners, Boss Fights are cool for people who likes them, mainly console players. We PC gamers idea of a good boss fight is Deux Ex I: we put mines everywhere, stupid boss appears, instantly explodes, next. Boss fights are uninteresting clunky gameplay, anti immersive. Of course they also make zero sense story wise. 

They're not horrible or anything but they just

never

ends

Here's a new one. A new one. A new one.

Here's a million Monolith people to kill. Over and over and over again.

Apparently I am very close to the end.

I won't end it. I am fed up. I want to puke. The game has been a purge, an absolute purge for 10 hours straight.

The game should have been half the size, but all the features. This is just horrible.

Now admitedly I've played in veteran, as I've played the other games a lot, including anomaly, gamma. Well, this difficulty is broken. Probably they should have created one veteran difficulty ""you've finished the other games"" and another higher one ""...and that one too"". 

There are plenty of really great things about this game. Atmosphere, the anomalies are by far the best they've ever been and after all big map is generous. But shit. You can see they really botched the end game.

EDIT: I did end it because I am an idiot. I have no idea what even happens. I see pictures, I hear words, I don't think I've ever been so out of a story ever in my life. I don't know what were the questions, what were the goals, what is the answer, what's happening ultimately and I can't possibly care to see other ending who will also be just as meaningless. 

This is a big problem because this kind of kills replayability. In theory you just play the game to have fun but while not being grating, in a way the story becomes just as much a punishement as in say Borderlands 3, like you're punished from playing the game with terrible, terrible storytelling that's rubbing its ass on your face. They could fix everything bad aforementionnend, at the end of the day if I restart the only credible move for the character is to turn back as soon as you have the controls because there is absolutely nothing for this guy in the zone. WE DON'T CARE AT ALL ABOUT WHAT THE ZONE IS. OR FREEING IT. OR DESTROYING IT. NO ONE. ON THIS WHOLE PLANET. THOSE ARE NOT RELATABLE STAKES WHATSOVER. WHO THOUGHT IT COULD BE. Jesus.",negative

"I think even without all the bugs, the game-play loop of stalker 2 is deeply flawed. Gun-play is average to sub-average at best, as of writing there are literally too many enemies that spawn out of your vision really close to you. Endless stashes that give you nothing of real value, and finally the durability of equipment is far too low to justify repairing with in repair bucks. WITH BUGS, I got soft locked about 10 different times and hard locked twice during the mission ""A minor incident"". I wasn't a fan OG STAKLER gun-play without mods and if you didn't either, than you wont like it here either.

The story however is good and interesting, but is it worth to trudge through bugs and poor encounters? Personally I don't think so.",negative

"This game has been out since November and still has shader issues and crashes often. Ridiculous, get it together. Im editing this review at 2/5/25. I genuinely cannot stand this game anymore there's so much wrong with it. So buggy and broken to date, I cant get to my bed cuz some NPC is blocking the bed, ridiculous and frustrating. Every enemy is a bullet sponge which makes the game so unfun. And the story just DRAGS. It NEVER ends and it doesnt get better at all. And there's so many areas you just cant even get into, I feel so limited. I ran all the way down to this dam and I couldn't even get inside it, so I had to go ALL THE WAY back. I could not not recommend this game more. This game is awfully made and still not fixed MONTHS later",negative
"Not bad but I'd rather play un-modded STALKER: Clear Sky. 

The fact that it's on Unreal Engine just utterly kills the game. Even on a decent system with everything on low, you still have terrible fps at points. Shame, could've been way better :/",negative
Bit buggy but still a very very good game,positive
"Game FPS is still barely running at 30fps and system should meet the requirements to run the game. But unfortunately it hovers around 15-28 fps, near settlement areas like in the beginning of the game it tanks down to 6-19 fps. Certain enemy camps have 10 second respawning. Wiped out 4 sets of bandits in a short span still in the camp itself.   Game seems like a blast but I just can't justify playing anymore. Maybe in a few months or a year I'll come back. Going back to Pripyat in the mean time.",negative
"I would definitely recommend this game - once the myriad of bugs are fixed.

Imagine putting in a 100 hours into this game, laboriously working your way through the lore, the quests, all the goings-on in the Zone.

Only for the final quest to bug out and realize all that was for nothing.

Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed the journey and I absolutely plan to replay it, once more fixes are in place.

To be honest, yet again we are asked to pay top dollar for a game that honestly could have used at least another 6 months being worked on, before any kind of release.",positive

"I was excited returning to the zone, while it has improved in many things obviously like graphics and sound effects. But unfortunately very disappointed in many design choices that took away from the charm.

- People in the zone are native English speakers (no eastern European accents)
- Lore breaking behavior and visual changes of NPC and mutants (flesh eye and their new behavior, majority of NPC stalkers not wearing masks, hard to distuingish important characters from regular NPCs
- combat and economy balancing issues 
- too short day/night cycle
- over the top anomalies and too often extreme weather conditions, almost space sci fi like
- unneccesary faction changes 

Overall kinda lost the OG stalker vibe and feels like every other game",negative

"While it could still use some polish, and won't be displacing Call of Pripyat as my favorite STALKER title yet, Heart of Chornobyl is still a game worthy of the STALKER name.

Good hunting stalker.,positive
"Stalker 2 should not have been released for another 6 months or so. I always wait at least a year for games releases due to so many games being poorly finished these days. I love the original stalker games so I thought just waiting a few months would be mostly fine. But no. There are a lot of bugs and gameplay problems. Lighting is poor, no nightvision, Ai that seems to have an aimbot, spawning enemies right next to you, stealth is basically non existent, enemies that can see you and track you through foliage, walls, vehicles etc, rushed or lacking content in places and so on.. This game is around 90% finished, they should have fixed the gameplay issues and most of the bugs before releasing.

Since the latest update I now can not play this game. It crashes within 10 minutes of playing.  I have wasted a lot of money on this and no refund is possible.",negative

"Great game! If you are fan of Stalker or Metro this is a must play.
Is this a next gen title? Probably not. It is very similar to the old stalker games (non moded), but with nicer graphics. Optimization sucks but with DLSS and frame generation it is pretty playable (above 60fps with RTX2060). Hopefully they will optimize it further. So far I haven't encountered any game breaking bugs, but im only 10h in. Even with all the problems Im having a blast. The shooting mechanics and the atmosphere are spot on for me. 
Cant wait to see what will modders do with this title in the future.
Highly recommended. See you in the Zone stalkers!

Many poor design choices like the mutant health pools/not dropping anything worth it, every scav npc is john wick with a snipershotgun wth??  mouse acceleration is ON by default.... list goes on...

Amazing game with tremendous potential. STALKER 2 captures the atmosphere and the feel of the original games. Slightly buggy AI is deadly on Veteran difficulty and the market system is kind of stingy when it comes to selling hard-earned loot.

The further you progress, the worse the game runs and the memory leaks get more severe. The game itself is very much a STALKER game and without all the technical issues it would be a great successor to the original trilogy. Can't recommend the game in it's current state, will update the review if the technical issues get fixed (I'm pretty doubtful about that since it's over two months from launch and none of the major issues are fixed yet).",negative

However, I'll leave a negative review because, even after a long time, there are still well-known bugs that haven't been fixed, and I have to deal with them using tricks. In Rostok, I have to save and reload every minute. Even after the last patch, which claimed to have fixed the issue, the problem unfortunately persists.

Range of view is very limited, the old games worked better even on my 2008 potato back then.

My main problem with the game tho is the missing Athmosphere due to A-life, bugs and , in my perspective, the poor performance of the engine. I wish there would be a a new X-ray engine which made the game feel different then others. Now it feels for me like a game like many others these days.

Patch 1.2 fixed my saves! But lets see what will happen next...",negative
"Just gonna say it right in the beginning, the game is worth it. It's really good. But the performance issues hurt it a lot. They are still updating it though, which is nice.

First Stalker game that I've ever played. Amazing experience.

Haven't finished the story yet, mostly doing a bunch of side quests and exploring but the story is intriguing. Not anything super wow. From what I gathered, it would be better if you have played the first game before this (Yeah I know, DUUUUH).

The guns are amazing. Very nice animations. Very nice sounds. Nice customizations and upgrades. And you can use different types of bullets like standard, armor piercing etc.

The inventory management is nice, but I would prefer it if some stuff didn't weight as much as they do. Oh well.

The world is amazing. Everywhere you go, stuff happens. I heard that the A Life system was much better in the first game and from stuff I've seen... yeah, but it's not that bad here. The world still feels alive. NPC's doing patrols, fighting mutated wild life, sitting around a campfire, telling stories / jokes.

Difficulty is ok. I have it on medium / stalker / whatever it's called. You can find a ton of food, water, energy drinks, medkits, bandages. Bullets are a tiny bit more scarce but it's still ok.

But... the enemy AI accuracy during gunfights is BS. You will be crouched, inside bushes and stuff, 100m away, and they will STILL spot you and start shooting at you with near PERFECT accuracy. I hope that they fix this cause that's my only issue with the game, well... except for the performance.

The latest update fixed the shader warmup getting stuck, but I still have to use a mod fix from nexus mods in order to get more stable fps.

"[h1]A Paradise Of Locusts Where Blade And Rifle Rule The Land[/h1]

Needs more time to cook. There's the bones of a good game here but it needs some heavy refinement before I can recommend it, particularly to anyone who never got into the original STALKER trilogy.

I can forgive some of the jank and technical issues and install mods to mitigate the gameplay issues somewhat but it just kept getting worse the further I got into the game. By the last third or so it got so bad , especially with some key story events, it felt almost like something out of a Vinesauce Corruption Stockpile video at points. Sometimes it led to some unintentionally funny and absurd situations but often it was frustrating and broke mission progression making many side jobs unable to be completed.

The story was the same deal. Good until the last act where it fumbles HARD and becomes an increasingly convoluted and incomprehensible slog full of fetch quests that send you running all the way back and forth halfway or more across the large but increasingly sparse and depopulated map until Pripyat where it turns into a clunky corridor shooter complete with tons of enemies, many of which have 1-2 hit kill weapons, spawning out of nowhere in areas you already cleared for the final couple hours.

I beat all three of the original trilogy and wile they were rough and janky, they were almost never as bad as STALKER 2 routinely got in that regard.",negative
In it's current state the game is unoptimized and buggy. Do not buy this game until they fix performance issues and buggy gameplay. I'd wait a year until everything is fixed before purchasing,negative

As of 02/03/2025 I'm an idiot. I don't know how, or why, or when, but some file got messed up, I re-installed, verified files again, and we're back to running with no crashes. If this happens again, I'll try to isolate what I was doing. Slava Ukraine.",positive

"STALKER 2 is a video game. It is a 7 letter word with a number at the end. The number is 2 which means it is a second video game. In this game you play as a person. As a person you travel from here to there. Sometimes things may happen. It takes place in Chornobyl. Chornobyl is a place that is near other places. It is near the other country named Russia. Russia is a very powerful country. Both country's are neighbors. If you play this game you will go on a adventure. You can use many weapons. Some of the weapons are a gun. I recommend this game and you will be unburdened by what is.

"I am a Stalker from the very original game, the 2 sequels and the mod Anomaly on PC. Stalker has always been one of my go to games even though its showing its age now, it's still very unique and more enjoyable than many modern titles. I have been waiting for Stalker 2 for many years.
However. prior to the 1.31 update I was very disappointed with Stalker 2.......I purchased the game, then requested a refund because it ran so poorly and was so bug ridden. I asked myself, is this piece of crap what we have all been waiting 10 years for ! I also wondered why they didn't use the Metro engine since that ran and looked very nice. The Metro games and Metro Exodus were and are fantastic games ! 
After the first big update 1.1 or 1.2 (don't remember) I decided to purchase it again and give it another go. It ran better, but was still not very good. So I messed around with it but never really got to playing it much till after the 1.31 update............Wow !, what a difference that update made......they restored my faith in GSC and Stalker 2 again !
I have run into the occasional bug, but ounce I sorted out what settings worked best I my PC, it has run great and has been a lot of fun. I like how they have refreshed all the familiar areas from the original stalker......and I think the gun play is much better than the original Stalker. I am a believer again ! I only have about 70 hrs into the game but have really enjoyed it. I haven't been following the main story yet, I have just been running around different areas of the map checking things out. I would also like to mention that I am running this game on an old X58 machine with a 990x and a 2080ti, and it runs fine. Started with low graphic settings then started turning some things on high, and a couple on epic. Honestly, the game looks very good on low settings and dose not look much better on higher settings accept for things like shadows and lighting.
Anyhow, I give this game 2 thumbs up since I have a deep appreciation of the original games !",positive

great bones. worth the 100 i paid easy. needs the a-life to be in a better state.,positive
"Not worth it in it's current state and maybe not worth ever. The charm of the Stalker games is the complexity and depth of the world. There is no depth here. Repetitve buildings, raw dumb gunfights, bullet sponges and lackluster artefacts.

It's pretty though, but that only gets you so far, since most of the game is spent running between places and if you are a loot goblin that becomes really tedious since you're always gonna be overencumbered and out of stamina.

The main quest isn't that serious but takes itself very seriously, not mention the amount of backtracking while completing it. you sometimes have to walk 2 km to another area to do one thing and then walk back.

Nvm game became super fun once I used the Mark I EMR and Gauss gun, up until that it sucked. 

Gauss gun go brrr",positive
"It is not Cyberpunk 1.0, but close to it.

The game could be great if not for the massive amount of bugs. The very start up to the first major missions works perfectly fine. The deeper you enter into the zone, the more broken things you will encounter.

I do not talk about occasional glitches, but quests breaking entirely. Many side quests are not completeable.


Once you were at Sircca and dragged yourself through that awful experience that needs a major rework, you are greeted with an even buggier game, where you cannot complete quests. The objectives fail, even if you did them.

Do not buy the game. Get back here in 2026 or something when they finally released a working game, because you will not finish some stuff without console mod and console commands.",negative
"This is my first STALKER game and in spite of its bugs and flaws, I found myself really immersed into it. I played most of it on version 1.1.3 and got to play a bit on version 1.1.4 as well before finishing it. At the moment I am happy to give it a 7/10. 

In case if a developer reads my review and wants to hear my advice on future updates, I suggest you improve the following aspects :

- Enemy AI. I found myself either a bit frustrated by the fact that the enemies could shoot me accurately through foliage, or disappointed by their lack of intelligence when they would completely forget about my existence after killing half their squad.

-Draw distance. The game has amazing visuals, but in spite of the fact that my draw distance was on Epic, I couldn't ignore how trees or various objects were popping in and out.

-And finally, performance. I know this is not an easy one because it may be engine related and the fact that this is a huge game, but not everyone has an RTX 5090 or a 7900 XTX lying around. Granted, the frame generation feature did a lot to make the game run butter smooth on my system (5700X3D and 7800 XT), but players with computers such as mine are rather the exception, not the norm.

Overall, I am happy this game made it out of the development phase and I am confident it will turn into one of the greatest open world games of all time provided you keep up the updates.

"The technical state in which the game has been launched is much, much more acceptable than what happened with its predeccesor. That being said, it's far from perfect, and becomes worse the further down the main storyline you go.
Just like Shadow of Chernobyl, it suffers from a insufferable ending sequence, which is poorly balanced (remember being sniped from a gauss rifle in SoC 20 times before you reach the ending? Yeah, it's the same old story here).
However, the return to Zona was an overall positive experience. I like the attention to detail when it comes to firearms, I adore the fact that the developers decided to reuse some of the sound effects from the original game, but most of all: somehow they managed to retain the overall atmosphere of SoC. The Zone is as oppressive as ever and you can feel it throughout the game.

I also found it to difficult, dying over and over again 20 mins with the first couple of monsters was frustrating. Yes it's supposed to be a bit hard but was too frustrating for me.
Other than that it looked amazing. Great colour and wonderful graphics :)

"	Having played the other games in the series I was excited to see what this new entry had to offer. The product we got and the product we still have is incredibly disappointing. The beginning was incredibly well done in preparing you for what the zone had to offer. Collecting loot, sneaking around, and choosing whether its worth it to engage or ignore certain encounters, even going from place to place required planning and making sure you were well stocked. As the game went on though, all of it seemed to matter less and less. I always returned from every trip to the zone with more healing items than I left with. It got to a point where sneaking became pointless because you could always outheal whatever damage you received. It felt that way with everything including water, food, ammo, and even suits. I was making so much money selling my surplus which trivialized any joy you got from upgrading weapons. 

	After a certain point in the game, everyone has exo suits and travel in packs of atleast five. You can't even sneak around them either because they spawn in eyesight of you and see you instantly. If you choose to fight, they will aimbot you into the ground and if you do manage to win, its usually something that you have like 300 of. After that point, it became pointless to fight and since I had so many health items, I ran past all fights to get where I was going. By the end of the game, instead of reminiscing on a game that brought me joy, I was glad it was over and uninstalled it quickly after because why would I want a game that is 153gb sitting on my hard drive. This doesn't even include all the bugs I faced, none of which were the fun ""slav jank"" and more along the lines of video and audio stuttering, quests being unable to start or complete, and occasional crashes.

	I wanted to like this game so much but the longer I played it, the more I realized that this wasn't what I hoped it would be. Even if they release bug fixes and make the work better, I can't see them fixing the overall issues of game progression, the weird pacing, and end game. If you are looking to buy it, I would wait a year or two and hope that something changes for the better.",negative
This game is everything I loved about the originals but better. True there are rough edges but once those are fully ironed out this will be a classic. Lots of existing mods help bridge some of the gaps as well. Story could be improved but the gameplay loop is really satistfying. Amazing coming from a studio in the midst of a war.,positive
"I've beating the game once, was fun and I didnt encounter any bugs till about half way through. My only main issue is the combat, every enemy has aimbot. they never miss a shot and later in the game its extremely annoying getting one shot every other fight I have. The enemies are also way too tanky, If they have armor it will take a whole mag of armor percing just to kill one. Although theres plenty of mods to fix it.",positive
10/10,positive
"Everything about this game impresses me as a huge fan of the first three games. Its so engrossing. Much scarier than the first ones. Much deadlier. But, its extremely rewarding, fun and an experience you will be so glad to have experienced. I am so impressed.
If its a big deal to you, wait till April 2025 (Six months after release) or get it on Games pass so you can play when the bugs are fully ironed out, although right now its in a perfectly playable state with no significant bugs. The worst one I experienced is a giant rat running into the base to hang out at my stash with me. I reported it and encouraged them not to fix it because I like him. 

Get it. Its good. Damn good.",positive
"I really tried to like this game but I just cant, there are some serious issues with the game:

1. Performance is horrible, unplayable without DLSS and Frame Gen (on a 4090) + a lot of graphics mods
2. Mutants are just bullets sponges and fighting them is just annoying, boring and unrewarding (they dont even drop loot)
3. Stealth is a joke and basically does not exist
4. The human enemies have wall-hack and aimbot
5. Absolute no-gos like just insta-killing you 15 times because you are ""not supposed to go in this area"" without telling you that you are not supposed to go there yet, a simple radio message or something would prevent this
6. Weapon and equipment degredation is so bad, that some quests COST you money because of how much you have to pay for repairs
7. The UI for the different ammo types is horrendous, how the fuck am I supposed to tell the icon for FMJ or AP appart when the icon basically looks the same, thank god this game does not have denuvo so I can mod it
8. Some more detailed status indicators about hunger, sleep, etc. would be nice
9. Please just add fast travel...
10. Please add backpacks or something similar so I can properly loot/take stuff with me (the stamina system is horrible), otherwise you have to walk back to your chest after every single time you find some loot

The story is great, the game looks great, when you install 20+ mods and turn down the graphics and overlook a lot of the stuff mentioned above its even fun to play believe it or not
But this game could be so much better...

tl;dr
Kinda sucks now but has a lot of potential, wait until major issues have been fixed and buy on sale


EDIT:
Had to use multiple console commands to be able to finish the game.
The last missions was just an absolut clusterfuck of unplayability, which gave the overall problems of this game an even worse aftertaste after finishing it.
I got to the point where I just ran through the last missions because of the instakillng bullet sponge enemies, which is kinda just sad since I really tried to like the game...
Maybe I will give it another go in a year or two...",negative

"Genuinely broken piece of shit. I have a RTX 4060 and a Ryzen 7900X, and It would be a fucking miracle if I even got 50 fps. That's not even mentioning the disgustingly apparent visual bugs. Don't listen to the Stalker fan soyboys who recommend the game, unless you would have sold your left kidney if it meant this game would come out faster.  You'll just be disappointed by the dev's sheer incompetence. Fuck you, GSC. You're what's wrong with video games these days.",negative
"Game is really fun don't get me wrong, but the optimization is not good whatsoever. Maybe it's a pc thing or some minuscule setting i'm not finding but at ultra graphics im getting between 30-65 fps, understandable makes sense, I turn things down to low and i'm getting 40-75 fps. Hopefully they fix this soon or I find the one setting that fixes this because I play for about 10 mins and get so bored from the low fps that I close the game.",negative
"A worthy sequel to a great game series. I've put a little over 60 hours into this game as of this review. I played the game on Stalker (medium) difficulty. There are variety of weapons, unique weapons, and nasty mutants to fight against along with fellow humans in the zone.

My largest complaint about the game is the ammo situation. Beyond the opening hours of the game when you have literally nothing to your name but a pistol and a few rounds of ammo, the availability of ammo seems to vary widely depending on where you are. It seem like certain areas are more likely to drop/have caches of specific types of ammo than others. Shotgun ammo seems to be the rare exception...mostly. 12 gauge ammo seems to be plentiful throughout the zone. Which is fine, because shotguns tend to be the more damaging close quarters weapon.

Sadly, costs to repair and upkeep weapons tends to get in the way of wanting to take chances on experimenting too wildly with other weapons. Your armor and weapons all take durability damage as you use them, and as you take damage in combat they take damage as well. Repairing and upgrading more than a select few weapons and armor gets VERY expensive VERY quickly. Early game upgrades for lower tier weapons can lull you into a false sense of security. After putting in around 30 hours, I found the amount of coupons (the in game currency) needed to upgrade the named/unique weapons becomes very steep. To the point where you need to balance upgrading your potential for damage and damage reduction with just keeping your gear in working order. 

Deferring repairs can be risky, because the lower the state of repair your weapon is, the higher the chance your weapon will jam in the middle of a firefight. :-( 

Story aside, Stalker 2 is wonderful game with good challenge and a breath of fresh air from a developer in a very unique and challenging situation.",positive

"they shit the bed on this one folks, i tried to be the ""be patient, give them time to update it"" guy, but every update feels like a step backwards, not to mention you've got to re-download the entire game every time they drop an update. Enemy AI does not miss. Ever. If you're 50 meters away hidden in dense foliage and behind trees at night, they will see you and blast you out of your socks. If you're behind cover, they will simply shoot you through the wall. If you actually manage to reposition yourself for a better angle for fighting, they already know exactly where you are. They will not miss a shot from a rifle, they will put grenades on top of your head consistently, and you will not have any ammo by the end of the fight. Some enemies take around 10 headshots to kill (zombies in red forest). Mutants are a complete waste of time and resources to fight as you cannot loot them, and the AI behavior is idiotic at the best of times. The AI rarely uses cover, and often would rather just rush you, getting as close as they can, their entire behavior is to rush you and try to melee attack you. Enemy AI also never uses any attachments on their weapons, they are all stock standard, broken weapons that would never function as reliably as they would for the player, yet the AI never experiences a weapon malfunction. Visually I'd give it a 7/10, some areas like forests are almost impossible to see in given the dense foliage, which does not affect the AI's aim in the slightest. Many buildings you find yourself fighting in are entirely too dark. ""Oh well they gave you a flashlight"". Skiff might as well be using a matchbox as a light source, the headlamp is next to useless. You can use it during the night time so that every hostile stalker and mutant can easily spot you and make your travel a living hell. In a zone of highly advanced armored suits and weaponry, the technology of night vision is a complete mystery. Except its not. It was in the very first game, which takes place years before this game. The game also has a piss poor reputation system, in which one wrong decision in an otherwise perfect playthrough will ruin your reputation with a faction, but even with the faction angry with you, you can still fast travel to the inside of their base and use their traders and other commodities. 4/10, just go play STALKER: Anomaly.",negative

"Amazing Game - great follow-up to the original Trilogy love playing it. Lore is amazing combat is quick and fun. You need to figure stuff out and don't get it fed on a spoon.

After Patch 1.2 my only issue is:
Some mutants are just pure bullet sponges with bad AI (especially Chimera and Pseudo-Giant)
in contrast to Bloodsuckers, Bayun and Snorks (among others) which have great AI but still die quickly when you know what to do and how to approach them in a fight.

"It's a shame. Stalker 2 had the potential to be a good game. The bugs, economy and early release of this game mean it is frustrating and a waste of your time. This game should have been delayed for a year and has fallen into Cyberpunk territory. Fair play to the devs for the frequent updates but it simply isn't good enough. Maybe this will change over time but you're better off waiting at least a year. This game is close to being unplayable.

- Can't walk through ankle deep water
- Multiple game breaking bugs, including main missions.
- Broken economy (guns and armour cost too much to repair meaning you're better off binning them after one use)
- Guns and armour degrade so quickly
- Dialogue is terrible outside cut scenes
- £50 for a game that is at best beta standard
- The weight limit is broken
- Gun mechanics are very poor
- Enemies are terrible. To increase difficulty they simply copy and paste terrible enemies.
- Bullet sponge enemies can use all your ammo in one fight.

It's a real shame as with a bit of work this could have been a great game. In it's current state, it's a complete waste of time. 

I'll give it a generous 3/10.",negative

"STALKER 2: Heart of Chernobyl – An Immersive, Beautiful, Thrilling Survival Experience with Technical Issues  

While the developers have patched some early problems, the game still suffers from a few game-breaking performance and optimization issues that can disrupt the immersion. At the time of writing this review, I’ve noticed that the game is not fully polished, and certain technical hiccups can sometimes pull you out of the experience. However, it’s clear that the team is committed to improving the game with subsequent updates, which gives hope for a smoother experience in the future.

That said, the visual presentation of Heart of Chernobyl is nothing short of stunning. The landscapes are beautifully rendered, with meticulous attention to detail that brings the desolate yet hauntingly beautiful environment to life. The game does an exceptional job of immersing players in this unforgiving world, ensuring that every corner you turn could yield both hidden treasures and lurking dangers.

One of the standout features is the variety of weapons available. Each weapon feels unique and serves a specific purpose, allowing for different combat styles and strategies. The realistic and visceral gameplay enhances the already tense atmosphere, making every encounter feel significant. Players are consistently challenged to think critically before embarking on missions—strategizing their approach and considering how they will handle the unpredictable threats that populate the Zone.

What truly sets Stalker 2 apart is the sense of vulnerability it instills. As you traverse the treacherous landscape, you’re constantly reminded that danger is always lurking around the corner. This unpredictability heightens the tension and makes exploring the world a thrilling gamble. You never know when you might stumble upon an anomaly or run into hostile factions, and you have to be ready for anything.

Overall, Stalker 2: Heart of Chernobyl offers a captivating journey through a uniquely immersive world filled with tension and danger. Despite its current technical issues, the game shines in its atmosphere, gameplay mechanics, and strategic depth. It’s an experience worth diving into for both fans of the franchise and newcomers alike. While it may not be perfect yet, it’s definitely a memorable and thrilling ride that I’ve thoroughly enjoyed. I'm hoping for further patches to refine an already exceptional game!

"Great game except all the bugs ::::::: The Rostok still has memory leak after patch 1.4>>>>>>> this is not good.
Been waiting for this bug to be fixed. I guess not yet. Otherwise game is great...got 187 hours in.",positive
"I've played the trilogy since 2007 (along with way too many mods, too many to list out in this review) and to be brought back to that time, to that unique art style and immersion is not possible with this release. I was expecting to get deep into another world of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. - to get creeped out by the mutants and underground labs, to enjoy a new interactive HUD, 3D PDA, gas mask interface, to get into super tactical gunfights against other enemy stalkers and so on.

Most of that did not get delivered and instead I was dealing with frustration trying to complete the game for the sake of just being done with it, main issues being horrible performance, input lag, un-intuitive AI and ray tracing washing out the colors of all the visuals in some scenes/areas.

UE5 does not do this game justice, the concept and idea of what it was supposed to be. In fact it just brings it down even more with half-baked AI, facial animations that predate the Half-Life 2 E3 demo, lighting that is very difficult to look at, washed out colors and rooms that are too bright or dark.

If more work was put into the X-Ray engine, I think the game would've definitely benefited from it, not just with stability and performance, but with AI scripting and A-Life being enhanced truly into how it was conceptualized back in 2003 with the original GSC team (thank you Prof <3).

It is hard to express how ambitious this franchise was from its infancy, how much potential it still has, to this day, even with mods.
It is an unfortunate disappointment to see this release underperform, with its showcases being focused more on the graphics and cutscenes rather than the gameplay and mechanics.

I still hope that some day we'll get the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. that fulfills our wish for an intricate and immersive open world, a world with its own unique design and art style, a world that is consistent with how the trilogy unfolded and ended, a world that had once long ago been born as just an ambitious idea...",negative

"Worst 50$ spent, every thing glitch out, enemy shoot thought cars and buildings.",negative
"Alright, here is my objective view on the game, I am 227 hours in as of this minute, so I think I have a pretty good grasp on it.
The game is great in many ways, gunplay is super nice, the graphics are great and environment is immersive
I am also a modder that has been working extensively on perfect its' aspects, click on my profile, if you would like to see mods that I have been gradually adding, that's my preface - I am a gamer that mods this game.

The problem with the game lays in things that need to work, that is missions that seem to break, making impossible to progress. I dove into Simple Mod Loader that allows to clip through walls because I was locked out of Malachite facility, the guard was either killed in an emission or killed during A-Life battle, even though he was supposed to stand guard. On that note I had to force a lot of missions using console commands, as in end missions by console commands and start them by console commands.

Golden underlining in this brought me to modding the game, so I change the damages, ballistics, I modded in 308 variant of M16 rifle, I changed mutant behaviors, I gave new abilities to mutants, I gave better loot drops that now spawn silencers and attachments in safes. I also gave faction specific weapons, I modded everything you can think of, and the game is alive for me, hence my 227 hours.  I gave Bloodsucker ability to knock down NPCs by modding it in. 

My most recent mod allows NPCs to respond to guns and they will actually engage you if you don't holster your weapon, so it becomes realistic. I increased battles of factions, I also allocated chances of battles between factions. I gave specific guns to Freedom reflecting them becoming the strongest faction, but more so, I made Mercs now rock all silenced weapons. Remodeled many weapons to have burst variants, created custom variants of existing weapons, preinstalled additional attachments, and all of the sudden game got super balanced.

Now Bandits have a chance against Monolith, but not everyone is rocking Viper-9 aka MP5, this was ridiculous before. Loners that barely make ends meet are rocking MP5s that cost $2500? Oh, no, no more of this. I gave them surplus M1 Variant rifle with irons, but then gave that rifle burst mode and made it as preferred firing mode, but also added auto mode if you were to find it yourself. Toz shotgun for Loner bros + M16 variant with 4X scope for their Sniper class

I rebalanced the whole game to make it more even and realistic. 
Mercs can now rock 4 burst variant Trophy, but dropping in low quality, so you don't cheese the game. Then Mercs don't spawn that often, so here is your chance to actually find something good, but you have to fix it.
2 round burst Vintar that is still silenced? They got it
308 Variant of M16? They got it. Swapped sounds
Added different calibers to weapons by logic. Swapped suppressors

This is among many things I have done, so when I recommend this game, I say that this game has a ton of potential, and I have been reporting a lot of stuff to GSC as they have been super receptive 

Funneling ideas and ways to fix certain things, but I want you to know that game files have a ton of cool stuff that is not in the game yet, and lots of mechanics that are not implemented.

NPCs responding to guns unholstered being one of them.
Cover mechanics and such will eventually be reworked, either by me or GSC, whoever gets to it first

On my 2nd playthrough I had zero issues with the guard spawning where he was supposed to be
So, what I am saying is that I definitely recommend the game, but you have to remember that it's not fully fixed as of yet, as of January 28th, 2025. There is a ton of work that can be and will be done by GSC and people like me.

I believe this can be one of the greatest games in my library if they rework AI. According to GSC and their emails to me, they are reworking AI as we speak.

I have made simple suggestions and complex ones to them.
Reworking Bloodsucker allowed me to give Bloodsuckers higher angle of impact too, and they quickly become a menace again, along with their knock down mechanic catching you and finishing you off if you are unlucky. I boosted health across for mutants and stuff like that.

Game is good, but it needs certain fixes, and I know it will happen eventually on GSC side and AI side will be expanded further, and then I can code in more stuff based on more complex nature of AI.

It's been a super educational experience for me, and I really enjoy the game after my work, but I enjoyed it even before that, so the natural modding came after my love for the game.

Come check out my profile if you would like to see what I have done already in terms of modding, and I look forward to GSC's progress

"The cons kind of outweigh the pros in this situation. Charging full price for the game in its current state is crazy, it should be under early access or have some kind of discount because the bugs are ridiculous. I can see how die-hard stalker fans would still recommend this game because it is still somewhat playable, and i get the situation that the developers are in right now. 
However, here are some of the things and ultimately the last thing that made me put the game down.
Absolutely trash voice acting, with the exception of the main character skiff, his voice acting is pretty decent. All the other npcs speak like a first gen text to speech program, the subtitles are messed up, and the emotion in their voices is often times wrong, like telling someone to say a joke but in a sad voice. ON top of that, sometimes the game just glitches out and you cant skip the dialogue, so your forced to listen to useless backstory in the before mentioned crappy voice acting. Occasionally, and i found this amusing, Skiff would talk to someone right in front of him through his radio for no reason. 
I guess more of a personal opinion as well but being forced to walk everywhere with a tiny backpack that isn't able to hold much is not that fun to me. If you need to get halfway across the map you'd better believe your going to be running for a solid 10 minutes, along with if you have more then what your tiny backpack can hold your going to be walking. 
I will admit that for most of the game I had some pretty solid fps and graphics, and no story breaking glitches occurred, such as a npc disappearing. 
That is until [spoiler] your second battle with Faust, whenever I tried to shoot at him, I don't know if its a memory leak, or the graphics are just to much to handle, but my PC will freeze up and crash the game [/spoiler]  
On the pros side, the atmosphere is absolutely gorgeous. The sound effects for the guns, and hearing other people shoot in the distance, is pretty realistic. The guns are fun to upgrade and handle on the realistic side as well. The artifacts are cool to seek out and find, and the music is actually pretty decent. 
Until the bugs are squashed and all story related game breaking glitches are fixed, I would have to say give this game a wait until everything is fixed.

"The AI in this game is F@# $**g bonkers. Enemies just respawn infinately even when u spend time and resources clearing an area with f$#@**g stealth and precision. Doesnt matter one damn bit. The devs just want u to cheese ur way thru and just sprint ur way thru an area. Rather than strategically spend a ton of time and fu@#$ng bullets clearing an area. So GD mad i bought this game and went past the threshold to get a refund. Game DOES NOT RESPECT YOUR GD TIME!!! I can not STAND enemies respawing, its such BS. Make it difficult and time consuming to clear an area, im cool with that. But when u just respawn wave after wave of enemies its such a let down. I cant STAND games that adopt this practice. if the devs wld just listen to the gd gamers and make the changes they cumulatively make, it wld be a game worth playing.

"I'm an idiot Stalker fanboy from the beginning and I can't recommend this game at this stage. I feel sorry for the devs trying to put out this game in a warzone and appreciate their efforts. 

Pros:
-Its a stalker game. The world is exactly what it is supposed to be with a fresh twist that makes sense in the timeline. 

-it looks great though I don't have the gpu to experience the glory.

Cons:
-it barely works. Persistent memory leaks leading to my computer completely crashing or freezing up requiring the plug get pulled from the wall. I guess Unreal 5 incorporated itself into not only the OS but the hardware as well. 

-enemy ai is literally an ai. They can detect a single uexpected pixel change in their fov at nearly infinite range, determine it is the main character, and zero in. When they start shooting they do not miss. The ridiculous dmg drop off on the weapons is the only thing that saves you, not even walls as they are literally wallhacking. Also ai fights are choreographed trash usually ending with both groups throwing a grenade at the same time, killing each other simultaneously. 

-weapon dmg drop off is insane. A 12ga shotgun firing 00 buckshot may as well be firing sand at 12 feet. Pointblank or nothing. 

-weapon stats are entirely made up and may as well be fantasy. Everything we know about ballistics and energy is undone. Ammunition has no real baring on dmg, penetration, range. All these things are arbitrarily hard coded into the specific gun. All smgs have higher penetration than all automatic rifles cuz balance or something... Watch what ammo type you use. A hollow point will degrade your gun more than a basic fmj. 

-mutant animations are sloppy and unpredictable making it extremely hard to fight them espcially with the massive input lag that is not a bug but a feature.

-input lag. 300-400ms... On purpose. This is not a multiplayer game. There should be no lag fucking ever. 

-the UI and controls are a joke. Radial menus that you can't ignore. Tailor made for your dumbest console player. Don't even think about remapping. There's no point. It generally isn't permitted. They don't believe there are enough keys on the keyboard for you to use so they made the decisions for you and you are going to resort to multiple functions for keys requiring long press and tapping. There are some secret binds that you aren't told about though... Smart. 

There is so much more that could be covered but this is enough for now. A lot of things can be fixed with early modding but the game stability is a real pain and unfortunately is reflective of almost all AAA games now.",negative
"It’s been an incredible experience. Even though I played it through cloud streaming, the game ran smoothly for the most part, and the immersive world of the Zone is as captivating as ever. The atmosphere, storytelling, and attention to detail draw you in, making each moment feel intense and rewarding. While I did encounter a few bugs that hindered my progress in the story, they were infrequent and didn’t significantly affect my overall enjoyment. The open-world exploration, the missions, and the tension throughout the game make Stalker 2 a must-play for both fans of the series and newcomers alike.

I personally recommend mods for this game. At the time of this review, it is a little buggy, a little rough. There are some wonderful and easy to install mods out there that really make it shine; one in particular is a 'ledge-grabbing' mod, allowing you to vault over much more than the vanilla game allows.

This game is an entire experience, and I'm thankful as heck that I picked it up. It's beautiful, the combat is great, and I actually enjoyed the story. I'm close to the end of the game, so I hope that this stays true all the way through.

"As many other reviewers have already stated (but also the developers themselves, if you watched their documentary or followed them on their social channels) the game was released unfinished, and after 2 months it still is. 
The dynamic system ""a-life"" does not work perfectly, the ai needs to be polished, the known issues regarding fps drops still have to be addressed (even though, at least in my experience, it does not happen often).
But the game is beautiful anyway, the real heir of the cult trilogy that only those developers can make, and you can enjoy.
In a not far future all technical issues and features will be solved, and the mod-maker community is already working.

"S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl – A Haunting Masterpiece

From the moment you step into the Zone, you feel it—the oppressive silence, the eerie glow of anomalies flickering in the distance, the weight of an invisible threat always lurking nearby. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 isn’t just a game; it’s an experience that pulls you into its desolate world and refuses to let go.

The level of immersion is unparalleled. The Zone is alive—mutants stalk through the ruins, distant gunfire echoes across abandoned villages, and radioactive storms force you to seek shelter or risk being swallowed by the chaos. Every choice matters, every bullet counts, and survival is never guaranteed.

Visually, the game is stunning. The detailed environments, dynamic weather, and haunting soundtrack create an atmosphere so thick you can almost taste the decay in the air. The AI is ruthless, making every firefight a desperate struggle where one wrong move can mean death.

Yes, there are occasional technical hiccups—glitches, performance drops—but they pale in comparison to the sheer depth and brilliance of the game. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 is not just another post-apocalyptic shooter; it's an unforgiving, gripping, and unforgettable journey into one of gaming’s most legendary settings.

Highly recommended for those brave enough to step into the Zone.",positive
"i spent 40 hours trying to beat the game with crashes, bugs and the game just not working at all,( i9 and 4080 witth 32 gb of ram). at the end, the boss fight was bugged beyond belief . i never got to kill strelok but i watched it on youtube. ",negative

Just finished reinstalling the game and I see there's a new patch with a bug fix for the memory leak but do I dare return to Rostock?  I think I'll go round and the traders can keep their extremely interesting gear!

So will I recommend it ??? Hell YES I absolutely love the stalker series and this icing on the cake after 15 years!!!!!",positive

"Since starting this game back in November, I started reading Voices from Chornobyl, a collection of interviews from people who survived the Chornobyl disaster. In August 2024 I read Roadside Picnic as well. Having read not only the fictional source material but the nonfiction source material as well has changed how I view STALKER. These are games that Ukrainians have built to explore their cultural identity. They explore and philosophize about the Zone. It's a game as strange as reality, where nothing is easy to write down or talk about. 

I enjoyed STALKER 2, I was wonderfully surprised this game was playable, considering all the trials and tribulations GSC went through to launch it. It's beautiful, wonderful, and strange. From the Red Forest to the swamps of Zaton, this game is a marvel to look at and inhabit. Gunplay feels amazing and every gun has a real weight to it. Fire fights are scrappy and dangerous. The story I thought was monotonous in the beginning but by the end had me on the edge of my seat. However, this game was released in the year 2024, it's unoptimized, runs poorly because of UE5, and was full of bugs; during the 2 months I played it, GSC made huge progress on game stability.",positive
ALIFE is a mess still. It's just spawning in enemies in your bubble and nearly forcing combat on your with factions and or mutants as well. It's a mess and obnoxious exploring the zone. A.i is their biggest issue with Stalker 2 and they can't seem to get it fixed.,negative
"I've played thousands of hours of Stalker and mods like Misery 2.2, Anomaly, GAMMA, and Escape from Pripyat.  I absolutely love stalker, but I can't recommend this game, yet.   The AI is horrible and shoots you through grass and trees and the world feels empty.   I haven't encountered one wild mutant while walking around.   Maybe it gets better but I already find myself trying to force myself to muster up enough motivation to play it and that's what I just did but after the last update, now my game is crashing.

I've had zero issues with performance or crashes before the last update and I sadly don't care enough to find a resolution because its a brand new game that I just paid $60 for.   I mean I even got a new computer that cost $2200 and I don't even want to play it.   

And I'm not a hater, I love stalker... but as much as I want to love stalker 2, its too broken in my opinion. 

I think I'm going to delete it and come back in a year or so to see how it is then.  I'm still giving it a thumbs up because I guess I'm still a stalker fanboy at the end of the day.",positive

"Game is great reminds me a lot of fallout 3 when it first came out.
Has some frustrating bugs and you're kind of forced to do the main story rather than explore.

Random areas will just be locked/have features removed so you cant access them until you're on the quest for that area and other places will have keys to find locally or puzzles to do that you're just supposed to explore which is good, but there's no way of telling the difference between a door you can unlock with a key or a door that is locked because you haven't hit a certain quest yet. Spent hours looking for a way into 4-5 buildings or a key to open a door or something eventually googling it to find out this area is quest specific and I can't do it yet if a door is quest locked it should have a red locked icon or something.

That's my main gripe, it's very open world but you get stunted by random areas and it's frustrating but all around an great game.",positive

Now fast forward to Windows 11 and STALKER 2 HOC and I'm still blown away. This team really has found the secret to making a good sequal, I only hope other studios follow suit.",positive
"Deeply enjoyable game. the seamless open world feels like the ultimate expression of what the zone is supposed to be, and I love the characters within. The devs didn't rest on their laurels with the factions, and you'll find that the old power dynamics have long since changed (freedom represent!) and new forces have entered the zone. while I haven't seen much in the way of actual bugs, the performance runs a range of anywhere from perfectly fine to dogshit, especially in the first town of the game, zalyssia. other Stalker bases seem to run well enough, but I haven't yet been to larger areas such as rostok, so i'm not sure about the other major bases. 
overall, I greatly recommend S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2, but maybe get some performance enhancement mods, these frames are no joke.",positive

"There are still  countless issues with the game such as NPC's materialising behind and in front of you which is probably the most annyoing one out there. The sound effects in the game are one of the best I have had the pleasure of listening too BUT at the same time audio is sometimes not audible(footprints of enemies) which makes detecting the enemy's direction from which they are comming from very difficult, especially during the night (nighttime feels very long compared to daytime).
The game has massive potential to be a very good game. 
Right now I can't reccommend it though . There are too many immersion breaking bugs but I am confident that they will get it right. It should have been in development for another year or so to be absolutely honest with you.

"Stalker 2 is possibly the best experience of a shooting focused RPG in a long while. Modernizing what was clunky with its predecessors whilst making the zone more beautiful and mysterious than ever before. While it does still (at the time of writing this) suffer from some occasional performance issues, none of these (baring one exception) have made the experience any less enjoyable.

For those not familiar with the series, STALKER is a sudo modern alternate reality where the Chornobyl power plants explosion occurred, scientists moved into the exclusion zone in order to perform experiments out of eyesight, then due to their meddling with the noosphere (basically an alternate plane of reality based on humankinds collective morality/emotion) cause a second explosion that warps and twists the reality of the zone.

It is into this setting that you are thrown into, and while fans of the series will recognize mechanics updated and refined from the previous games, STALKER 2 does a great job at introducing these mechanics to a newcomer at a reasonable pace to get them up to speed. The story does not require that the player have experienced the previous titles, but certain scenes , locations, and characters hit harder if you did.

The Zone is massive. truly dwarfing the size of previous games by combining functionally all previous maps, expanding the areas those maps comprised of in all instances, and adding entirely new regions on top of that. Plus regions that were previously ""fudged"" to make the story work have been updated to reflect their real world counterparts more closely. Exploring has never felt better.

The games limited survival aspects still feel mostly ""tacked on"". Eating food ends up being more of a ""light heal"" than it ever is for avoiding hunger. Sleep (newly added) does occasionally force you to rest and I suspect is a clever way the game allows certain areas to ""reset"" alongside emissions.

Ive seen some people criticize the implementation of the worlds ALife 2.0. For those unaware, Alife was functionally AI programming that made NPCs go out and act on their own accord with their own objectives. After playing through all 3 of the previous games, I can safely say that I think Alife was blown slightly out of proportion for how good it was via nostalgia. The reality is that previous games in the series either had functionally no AI (shadow of Chernobyl) or extremely trigger based ones that created the illusion of a smarter AI. This was most notable in Clear Sky where factions were actively at war and effectively fighting over predetermined places on the map. The Ai would send a squad to capture these points and radio calls could go out alerting the player to these attempts (both defending or attacking a point). This led to the world feeling more alive and active (if you ignored the seemingly endless manpower all the factions had). STALKER 2 does not have the faction wars in this sense and has reverted to SoC/CoPs ""spawn AI at predetermined locations"". where the AI will fight rivals they might encounter, but these are functionally scripted events. STALKER 2s initial problem was that the AI could spawn in so close to the player, the immersion of running into these fights was lost. While I do think it would be cool to implement some kind of faction war, I think the community at large is fooling themselves as to what ""A-life"" actually was.

STALKER 2 bills itself as a non-linear story and that is a half-truth. The game has 4 distinct endings, and 2 ""faction paths"" based on who the player aligns with during the campaign. these diverting mission paths do add some replay value, but it doesn't change the outcome and the story isnt as freeform as a traditional RPG game or even previous entries in its own franchise (CoP had endings that varied based on who you sided with and what quests you followed through on in the fashion of fallout new vegas end slides). Here, based on a very obvious binary tree, you get your ending choice. Nothing you've done prior, is brought up or made relevant, which feels like a huge miss for the wealth of side quests and chains the game has.

Despite these minor complaints, the sheer scope of the zone and its inhabitants simply make just wandering and exploration a treat. The comparable bethesda games pale in comparison with each location, despite being a collective of eastern European abandoned factories, warhouses, apartments, and so on, feel so real compared to the same copy and paste settlements of fallout 4. While the story is linear, its also the best presented in the stalker series by far, especially in the character department.

TL:DR

"A-life 2.0 was promised by the devs.  Launched with no a-life and NPCs that just spawn right in front of you.  They drop right into your view and start fighting other enemies that dropped right behind them.  NPCs also shoot you through walls and sometimes know where you are regardless of what you do. 

World feels completely empty without Alife.  The spirit of the zone from the originals were driven by Alife.  It was what made stalker unique.  But now that soul is missing and this strange husk is left behind.

Nothing like getting an achievement for camping with a group of stalkers when its only me sitting at the campfire because npcs don't actually use them like promised.  

Environments are well done.  Quests are okay (decent but not memorable).  

Gunplay is average.  So far haven't seen anything better than the original in the game.  

Until Alife is added,  I cannot recommend this game.  

",negative
"This game will take you back to the zone; however, you’ll quickly see the flaws since it wasn’t totally finished. The lack of A-Life is noticeable. Enemies spawn right in front of your face, and the ‘AI’ – not to be confused for what is “AI” these days – is a shooting gallery, enemies that will laser you, know where you are at all times, see your flashlight in walls. In the old STALKER games, especially the modded versions, the AI is probably the best I have ever experienced in an fps. In fact, every FPS game I play I sort of internally judge if it is better than the old Stalker AI. Very very few get close to the old Stalker’s games.

The story is a bit confusing. The only thing I knew was that Monolith was resurrected and had to be stopped. Everything else was a wtf. But Strelok is an icon at this point, every future Stalker game must have him. Even I felt like Marked One a player character felt like a legend. Skif is okay but he feels more like an action movie star.

The soundtrack is a perfect blend of the old and new. I listen to “Cordon” and even the main title for that twist on the old Stalker end credits. “Lesser Zone Day” is another good one. Mostly a great job there.

Once again, if Steam had a middle ground rating I would give this that. It’s currently very buggy. Quests are broken. Boss fights are broken at the time of this review. Unreal Engine wasn't the best choice for this game.

I give this a side-thumb! Maybe a 7.7/10 or something. Play when all the bugs are fixed.",positive

"Overall, this is a fun game that balances exploration, looting, and combat pretty well.  The graphics are solid, and the world building is great.

I only have two main grievances.

First:  There are certain key bindings that are not available for reassignment.  Melee attack with your equipped weapon is bound to ""V"", and this setting is omitted from the bindings menu.  There are others like this, but you get the point.  This is a basic quality of life feature that I cannot believe is absent.

Second:  In the early stages of the game, the only traders with unlimited funds are in the main camp.  After first leaving the ""Lesser Zone"", I spend most of my time walking all the way around to the West to cross the only bridge back so I can sell my loot.  Combined with the limited weight capacity, this process becomes very tedious.  Most of the profits made are then spent on having to repair all my gear, which leaves little for upgrading/buying stuff.  I get that this is to slow the pace, but it's painfully boring at times.  I hope this becomes less of an issue as the game progresses.  Otherwise, I will quickly grow bored of the extremely long walks back and forth simply to sell loot.",positive

"To be honest, I thought a survival game might be a boring game. You have to manage everything like health, hunger, or other harmful status while progressing your story. But if you like exploring The Zone like me, you'll love this. There are a lot of places to go or explore, even a tiny shack on the road. Shooting hostile people who are pointing a gun at you. A gunfight is a little hard and feels challenging. 

Some veteran STALKERs told me dying in The Zone could happen every second. The game may seem very hard at the beginning since you're new and learning the game system. And when you find something interesting and want to go check it, just press the quick save button and go. 

It's hard, but not much. You can research how to get some good equipment that could help you easily explore The Zone.

Except for one thing I don't like. I have to manage carrying weight, so I cannot take everything with me on the way. But I'll adapt because I'm a STALKER too.

There are some bugs that cause the game to quit itself or freeze, but it's not too often for me.

Anyways we paid for this game, we paid for the aggravation. But we love the franchise. A very close line could be drawn for Tarkov fans which I am apart of.

Overall 8/10 (Game's good, buy it)

Gunplay 8/10 (decent selection with a few attachments and modding, recoil isn't crazy, leaning allows for good positioning)
Gameplay 8/10 (some questionable arcadey game choices in health and weapon stats)
Story 10/10 (continuation of the great foundations made by the source material and original trilogy, puts larger AAA titles to shame)
World Design 10/10 (The zone is richly detailed with diverse scenery and POIs, absolutely stunning)
Audio 8/10 (SFX are godlike, UA Voices 10, EN Voices 7 - still had some silent audio emitter bugs post 1.1)
Lighting 3/10 (Beautifully unplayable, the worst part of the game)
Bugs 4/10 (MSQ mostly fixed, some quest breaking bugs still require reloads, some AI jank to be expected)
Perf 6/10 (generally not a smooth 144fps experience or even 60fps, stutters when the game has to instantiate a lot of AI agents like near towns, occasionally impacts gameplay even on a higher-end PC - i7, RTX 3080, 32GB RAM, SSD)

===== FULL REVIEW ======

The game is much better since the 1.1 patch - it feels like stalker again. The anomalies look and sound amazing and hunting for artifacts feels great - apart from the coupon value which is moddable. The gunplay is great and it has some of the best firefights of any shooter I've played. When the AI is swarming, flanking, and suppressing me in a large prolonged fight - I'm no longer playing a game, I'm fighting for my life. Not quite the adrenaline pumping shakes of a Tarkov PVP engagement, but likely the closest thing you'll find in a single-player experience right now. That being said, the AI and mission scripting can still go off the rails. 

Along with the main story and side quests, there are many little events & stories sprinkled throughout the zone which give it character beyond that of the earlier titles. 

The sound effects are incredible, making mundane moments tense and gunfights even more thrilling. I played most of my hours with the Ukrainian voice acting - which is top tier, crisp and filled with emotion. I tried English for a few hours, but the lines didn't have the same impact for me.

While I'd still consider it early in the modding scene, grabbing a few mods to change the following really upped the immersion - mutant part looting, remove detector beeping, increased consumable scarcity, economy/artifact changes, and an engine.ini conf.

Yet for all I like about the game, there are still some things I'd have improved, specifically enemy health, weapon stats/scaling, and the lighting system.

For a game/franchise/following with such a realistic feel, the health of foes feels like a game design decision which needlessly detracted from the realism. I would have enemy health reduced. Specifically for the higher-tier mutants and exosuit stalkers. To me, spongy enemies break the immersion. The difficulty of encounters as you meet higher-tier mutants or stalkers should not be in how many headshots they need to take, but in how you counter the specific capabilities they bring to the fight - a bloodsuckers speed and invisibility, a buerers force-field, controllers line of sight, a stalker's weapon-caliber/range and armor.  Yes, you're getting stronger weapons to counter these foes towards the end of the game, but I still don't feel like 3+ 5.45/5.56 headshots to an exosuit or 6 shells of buckshot point blank to a bloodsucker expresses lethality appropriately.

The scaling penetration of guns within the same caliber feels acadey and immersion breaking - i guess to incentivize players to keep exploring new weapons. Perhaps squishing the penetration values and providing some other incentive to swap weapons within the same caliber (like exclusive modifications and attachments) could be enough to maintain the desire to explore new guns without feeling like I'm getting railroaded into swaps. One can hope GSC or a committed modder will address this somehow.

Now the lighting, this is perhaps the place where realism got in the way of good game design. When it’s not getting in your way and being absolutely punishing, it’s probably some of the most realistic lighting out there. Sadly it’s not enjoyable to play with, almost ever, darkness is so complete with what felt like no global illumination. Originally I had been using around 50 brightness and 33 gamma where I assumed the developers intended when I calibrated the settings at game start - and to their credit the game looked great  at first. However, by about 6 hours into my playthrough I gave up on their punishing lighting implementation and cranked the gamma and brightness up into the 70's, just to have a chance at seeing foes in relatively unlit interiors - or see anything at all during night-time expeditions, which I frequently found myself in with the vast map size and short day cycle. Afterwards, the colors were washed out, but the game was more playable. An unfortunate trade-off which I'd think could be corrected with changes to their lighting, but idk maybe not with how they're using UE5/Lumen/RT.

Yes there are some bugs and jank, some quest will break and require a reload. The biggest offender (defense of zaliyssia) was fixed in the 1.1 patch, but others remain. Sometimes the AI's ESP is too good and they wall-bang me deep in cover during what should be suppressive fire on the last contact point. Human foe vision is to good in low light and brush coverage, their aim simplistic and lazer-like. Animalistic mutants like dogs take cover as a human would when you're inaccessible - like when jumping on a box.

Overall a great return for the Stalker franchise, an enjoyable game in the current state even with its flaws. Well worth the price and it can only get better with age.

"This was my introduction to the series (Sorry for hardcore fans). However, the story was amazing and worked well on its own. I know now that there's a lot more lore in previous games but it holds its own. Definitely RECOMMEND playing the other games first. If you're looking for a very beautifully told story and a smooth game without the early 2000's graphics THIS is the game for you.",positive
Good game.,positive

"I want to like it so bad, but it just doesn't WORK. The balancing around stamina, items, damage along with the endless technical problems makes every interaction with the game so painful that the good parts just don't seems that good in comparison. Needed another 6-12 months in the oven. Sucks.",negative

"I will spoil the first thing everyone think of: Will you be able to go to reactor 4 at the Chernobyl Power Plant where the most devastating nuclear accident in history happened in April 1986?

The answer is no, not yet. That part of the map is there but clouded over and if you try to go there, will kill you in seconds due to radiation. 

If you do want to go there, the original STALKER game Shadow of Chernobyl let's you get close.
More than close, it allows you inside the reactor 4 core room. And depicts it very well for an almost 20 year old game. 

Anyway STALKER 2 follows a different path, the story of the original trilogy gives you very little reason to visit the old plant. It had it's story and this game has it's own.
If you want a plausible explanation is that the Zone has emissions every now and then.
Completely changing it each time. Which is also a major part of STALKER 2's story.

It's still the Zone. And it's more deadly than ever. 
Using the Unreal 5 engine brings it to life unlike any of the previous trilogy did.
It's consequences of not being careful will cause you to often pay the ultimate price.

The original trilogy while realistic, was in their way a lot more forgiving than STALKER 2.
Unless you played them at the hardest difficulty.

Which is STALKER 2 at easy.

Bloodsuckers taking a shotgun shell and was easily visible even when trying not to be?
Here they are invisible! And make short hit and run attacks on you and usually only comes out at night.
Where they are even harder to see when they're breaking cover. And they're everywhere. 
Not just in designated places. When you least expect it.

Bandits? Will be attracted to gunfire, you fire your gun... Because of those pesky mutant dogs.
Be prepared to be surprised.
They are everywhere, they can see you way faster than you see them.
Foliage is much more dense but it doesn't bother them. They will find you.
You will get a notification but my advise is still: RUN.
And they throw grenades.
You face more than two? You better have a good cover and be prepared to leave it.

I bought this game after watching the Chernobyl miniseries.
And then I had to go back to the original game just to compare.

The difference is massive in game play.
It's a combination of the original game in way of feel.
But keeps a lot of systems from Clear Sky and Call of Pripyat.

Trust me, you want the night to allow for low visibility right? To travel more unseen.
Think again. It works more in everything else's favour than yours.

In the original trilogy I never feared the night.
In STALKER 2? You will.... You will.

Anyway is this a finished and polished product.
Absolutely not. It has crashing issues, it still has issues with quests sometimes being impossible to complete.
(So does the original game btw, almost 20 years later)
But this is a new engine. Unreal 5 is notoriously difficult to work with due to the high level demand it puts on developers. Easier than building your own and it's still a massive improvement over the original trilogy's X-Ray Engine. (Which was very impressive as well when the original games game out)
But gone are the semi open world hubs.

STALKER 2 is a seamless open world, while there are still regions. There are no loading times transitioning between them. You're simply crossing the borders. Which I would arguably say is one of the biggest selling points. Make the map around 600% larger too while you're at it.

A lot of the original places from the main trilogy is still here. Just moved around a bit to conform the region's actual layout. For example you previously had to go through the town of Pripyat to get to reactor 4.
While it is actually situated shortly north west of the plant. And now it is exactly that.

It's an impressive game. Even if it still requires a lot of work.
And is keeping the homage to the original trilogy in control and atmosphere.
The Story? C'mon did any of us play these for it? But it is there and better than before with the exception of the English voice acting is ridiculous. It was actually charmingly better in the original trilogy with the Balkan accent. It's sadly gone here.

Instead we do get the option with full Ukrainian dialogue. Now I don't speak this language so I don't know how good it is. But to me, it sounds better with subtitles. Because the English is just cringe.
Also your protagonist is now fully voiced. Alex Montyro doing the acting in English does a decent job of it while also tending to sound somewhat lost at times, Which doesn't fit Skif's back story.
Dmytro Gavrylov who voices Skif in Ukranian sounds much more... serious yet laid back. Professional.
Something you would expect from a person with a military career and seen real action.
Not sure if this is really the case but spending six years in Bulgaria... He sounds like Bulgarian police.

Overall sound is vastly improved. Nature sounds like nature and not a looping sound.
Gunshots in the distance as AI combats bandits and mutants bring you to instantly hit the crouch button.
Atmosphere in the Zone has never felt more real. And never more frightening.

While STALKER 2's mechanics are very similar to the Call of Pripyat.
It for example does not sport a personal tinkering system or crafting like Metro Exodus did or take it further, like the Fallout games have. It instead allows more like Crysis to add a scope or detach it at will, you don't need a workbench for it. But you will need to go in to inventory. Which is no longer as seamless as the previous games, there is now an animation for that. Same as with eating etc.
Which is something they brought back. As it was removed from Clear Sky and only gave you health.

You cannot craft healing items either however. There is no scrap system in this game.
The main difference I found from the previous ones when it comes to loot... You cannot sell a weapon that is near breaking. (Red condition) Which removes the incentive of picking up every gun you see and haul it back to a trader. As it will be more expensive to repair it and then sell it.
But if you happen on something in good condition you have no intent to use? It's worth it.
But you might in the beginning want to hold on to it instead and do use it if needed.
It fixes the economy problem from the original games to a certain amount.
STALKER 2 keeps the equipment repair & improvement system from Clear Sky.


I will not give this game a score, as I'm only 7 hours in writing this.
However it is looking at a very strong 8/10 as things are.
Glitches and all.",positive
Definitely makes up the +150gb storage by graphics and storyline.,positive
Game world feels empty and bland. Enemies spawning within 30m of you makes engagements boring and lacking in a lot of the tactical decision making.,negative
great game. lots of fixes need to be made,positive
"Dude told me to give him a quest item and betray the other guy I was originally getting the item for. Went on a rant about how you got to be cut throat in the zone really laying into me. So I changed my mind and sold him the item for a nice custom gun, then killed him with that gun and took the item back and gave it to the OG guy it belonged to. What did he expect? - Such is life in the zone.

I pray for CO-OP.",positive
Do you like being kicked in the nuts on a consistent basis? I didn't think so either but this game might turn it into a fetish of mine. 10/10 would recommend this game.,positive
Awesome game !!!!!,positive
